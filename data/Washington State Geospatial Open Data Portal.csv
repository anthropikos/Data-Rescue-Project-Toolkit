Defoliation damage presented in this dataset is active whereas mortality is passive as it typically takes a year or more for afflicted trees to exhibit the characteristic symptoms of decline (i.e., bright red, orange, or yellow foliage). Generally speaking, defoliation data is measured the year it occurs, and mortality data represents insect and disease activity that took place a year prior to the date it was recorded. Likewise, trees killed in a given year will not show in aerial survey data until the following year. Only trees displaying the distinctive colors and patterns of recent decline, otherwise known as ""damage signatures,"" are documented. For example, when bark beetle damage is observed, a polygon is drawn on a digitized map denoting the location and range of the damage. Polygons are then given a shorthand code suggesting the most likely damage agent (e.g., code: 6L for mountain pine beetle in lodgepole pine) and a relative severity percentage of affected trees within. Trees that have been dead over a year appear white or grey and are excluded from these assessments. Surveyors choose from five damage severity categories when creating polygons: Very Light (1-3%), Light (4-10%), Moderate (11-29%), Severe (30-50%), and Very Severe (>50%). These five damage severity categories are then recalculated into “trees per acre” (TPA) estimates to remain consistent with historical WA DNR aerial detection survey datasets and reporting. Note: the causal agent of forest damage and mortality is an educated guess. Post-season ground surveys are implemented to validate observations made by aerial survey personnel and serve to reinforce accuracy as remote-sensing specialists. No vertical data is recorded.","Pacific Northwest,DNR,Washington State,aerial survey,forest disturbance,biota,forest health,insect damage,forest insects","The Department of Natural Resources uses this data to describe the location and intensity of forest disturbance activity on an annual, statewide level.

The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system.

The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.

The NHD is a national framework for assigning reach addresses to water-related entities, such as industrial discharges, drinking water supplies, fish habitat areas, wild and scenic rivers. Reach addresses establish the locations of these entities relative to one another within the NHD surface water drainage network, much like addresses on streets. Once linked to the NHD by their reach addresses, the upstream/downstream relationships of these water-related entities--and any associated information about them--can be analyzed using software tools ranging from spreadsheets to geographic information systems (GIS). GIS can also be used to combine NHD-based network analysis with other data layers, such as soils, land use and population, to help understand and display their respective effects upon one another. Furthermore, because the NHD provides a nationally consistent framework for addressing and analysis, water-related information linked to reach addresses by one organization (national, state, local) can be shared with other organizations and easily integrated into many different types of applications to the benefit of all.","/Categories/Water and Shorelines","See dataset specific metadata.","None.

Higher resolution boundaries are being developed where partners and data exist and will be incorporated back into the WBD. WBD data are delivered as a dataset of polygons and corresponding lines that define the boundary of the polygon. WBD polygon attributes include hydrologic unit codes (HUC), size (in the form of acres and square kilometers), name, downstream hydrologic unit code, type of watershed, non-contributing areas, and flow modifications.

Outcomes of snow and ice control treatments will vary, dependent upon severity of winter weather events, topography, traffic levels and speeds, and proximity to support facilities (i.e. liquid chemical storage tanks and salt stockpiles). While outcomes can be measured in a variety of ways, the motoring public most often measures maintenance efforts in terms of road conditions during and immediately after winter weather events. Maintenance personnel also rate roadway conditions during the winter season. This information is used to project expected road conditions associated with snow and ice treatment levels for different events. The unique nature of individual winter weather events limits the relevance of projected expectations on a given storm, but when ratings from an entire winter season are averaged, they become a good indicator of the Level of Service (LOS) provided by maintenance personnel over the entire season. Winter climates differ greatly between Eastern and Western Washington, so road treatment levels may vary on either side of the Cascades to match the ability to respond to those conditions.

Results consist of three types of outcomes: Bridge Damage Levels and Types, Bridge Repair Types, and Bridge Reopening Times. All output is a part of this feature class. Bridge damage types are projected on the basis of both damage level (None, Moderate, Significant), whether a bridge is a special bridge type, and also the types of damage that the bridge will experience (including both direct seismic and secondary earthquake-induced impacts); The projected repair types and reopening times necessary to bring bridges back to a minimum level of functionality that enables their use for emergency response were computed using the methodology specified in the Bridge Reopening Times section. Refer to the BSST Technical Report. The BSST was developed to assess the potential impacts of a CSZ earthquake to highway bridges in Washington State at a system-level as part of the Washington State Transportation Systems RRAP project. The results provided identify the Damage Levels, Damage Types, Repair Types and Reopening Times associated with 2,717 bridges located in Western and Central Washington that were evaluated for this RRAP project. Understanding that this analysis likely constitutes a “worst-case scenario” with respect to bridge damage, the results nonetheless project that the majority of bridges in Washington State will experience moderate to significant damage resulting from a CSZ earthquake. While the majority of bridges that experience damage could be reopened within one year of the earthquake, a substantial number of those bridges (28.7 percent) are projected to take more than a year to reopen—in many cases 2 or more years. The results also project that while many bridges may be reopened after either minor repairs/inspections or the construction of a temporary bypass road, a substantial number of more significantly damaged bridges (797 structures) span bodies of water and will require complete replacement prior to reopening. This suggests that significant gains in roadway corridor reopening times could be gained by focusing on retrofits or upgrades to these more vulnerable bridges that span rivers and other bodies of water. This tool is primarily intended to inform regional highway prioritization for emergency response activities; however, the BSST provides a useful evaluation methodology that could be applied to other regional emergency preparedness and infrastructure assessment studies. This could include studies of bridge infrastructure to other potential seismic events within the region, or at varying jurisdictional levels (i.e., county, local). The BSST also uses currently available seismic, seismically-induced secondary hazard and infrastructure information. As new seismic information becomes available, or as secondary-hazards (e.g., landslides, avalanches) become characterized more comprehensively, such information could be integrated into the current BSST methodology. Similarly, as seismic retrofit activities or other infrastructure improvement projects continue throughout Washington State, or as new infrastructure are built, it will be important that the infrastructure data integrated in the BSST also be updated periodically. Doing so will ensure that planners and infrastructure managers maintain the most current and complete understanding of the network-level seismic risks of a CSZ event to Washington State highways.Please note that all results from the BSST are based on a model and information received from WSDOT. Damages from an earthquake may be different that what is provided here. Liquefaction data was used within the BSST tool. WADNR is the source for liquefaction data and is available here: https://www.dnr.wa.gov/programs-and-services/geology/geologic-hazards/geologic-hazard-maps#nehrp-site-class-and-liquefaction-susceptibilityUSGS ShakeMap was also used in the BSST tool for a M9.0 Cascadia earthquake and is available here: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/scenarios/eventpage/gllegacycasc9p0expanded_se/shakemap/pga. DHS distributed this data to WSDOT on August 22, 2019. UPDATE: 5/5/2025.

In 2017, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) sponsored the Washington State Transportation Systems RRAP project in coordination with the Washington Emergency Management Division (EMD), Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), and other regional stakeholders. This project is focused on assessing the impacts of a Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) earthquake on state transportation systems and, in particular, how those impacts may affect the ability of emergency response efforts to move supplies into the region. The intended outcome of this analysis is the prioritization of transportation routes and modes for additional planning, investment, hardening, or other activities to enhance their resilience—and therefore, to enhance their ability to support response and recovery efforts following a CSZ earthquake. An important part of this transportation system-level assessment has been to assess the seismic vulnerability of the state highway system. In doing so, the RRAP project team developed a Bridge Seismic Screening Tool (BSST) to assess, at a system-level, the potential impacts that a CSZ earthquake could have on state highway bridges. The first step in the BSST is to assess the seismic vulnerability of highway bridge infrastructure in Washington State following a CSZ earthquake to determine a projected or potential damage state. Damage states are then used to determine approximate reopening times for bridge crossings.","/Categories/Planning,/Categories/Roadway Infrastructure","Washington State Department of Transportation","For Planning use only.

This survey is a cooperative effort between the U.S. Forest Service and the WDNR where two trained aerial surveyors sit on either side of a high-wing plane and sketch forest damage observed below. The primary mission of the survey is to record recently killed and defoliated groups of trees throughout the state, and to continually build a historical record of forest health trends. The majority of damage found is caused by insect and disease damage agents; however, trees killed by root disease and early spring feeding of black bears, or by abiotic events such as winter storms, fires, floods and landslides are recorded as well. Current defoliation can be detected as soon as the affected foliage changes color that year. However, whole tree mortality is not current since only flagged trees (i.e., trees which have a bright red, orange, or yellow foliage color) are recorded. This means that trees killed the year of the survey will not have changed color yet and a one-year lag time results. Only trees exhibiting distinctive colors or ""signatures"" are documented. For example, when bark beetle damage is spotted while surveying, a polygon is drawn on a digitized map of the size and location of the damage. The polygon is then labeled with the appropriate damage agent (i.e., code: 8 for Western pine beetle) and the percentage of trees affected within five damage severity categories. It is an educated guess as to the causal agent. We therefore use ground surveys to reinforce our estimates as much as possible.

Large data sets like this one, for the State of Washington, may exceed the limits for downloading as shape files, excel files, or KML files.  For areas less than a county, you may use the map to zoom to your area and download as shape file, excel or KML, if that format is desired. Information for SOILS data layer was derived from the Private Forest Land Grading system (PFLG) and subsequent soil surveys. PFLG was a five-year mapping program completed in 1980 for the purpose of forestland taxation. It was funded by the Washington State Department of Revenue. The Department of Natural Resources, Soil Conservation Service (now known as the Natural Resources Conservation Service or NRCS), USDA Forest Service and Washington State University conducted soil mapping cooperatively following national soil survey standards. Private lands having the potential of supporting commercial forests were surveyed along with interspersed small areas of State lands, Indian tribal lands, and federal lands. Because this was a cooperative soil survey project, agricultural and non-commercial forestlands were included within some survey areas. After the Department of Natural Resources originally developed its geographic information system, digitized soil map unit delineations and a few soil attributes were transferred to the system. Remaining PFLG soil attributes were later added and are now available through associated lookup tables. SCS (NRCS) soils data on agricultural lands also have been subsequently added to this data layer. The SOILS data layer includes approximately 1,100 townships with wholly or partially digitized soils data. State and private lands which have the potential of supporting commercial forest stands were surveyed. Some Indian tribal and federal lands were surveyed. Because this was a cooperative soils survey project, agricultural and non-commercial forestlands were also included within some survey areas. After the Department of Natural Resources originally developed its geographic information system, digitized soils delineations and a few soil attributes were transferred to the system. Remaining PFLG soil attributes were added at a later time and are now available through associated lookup tables. SCS soils data on agricultural lands also have subsequently been added to this data layer. This layer includes approximately 1, 100 townships with wholly or partially digitized soils data (2,101 townships would provide complete coverage of the state of Washington).-

The soils_sv resolves one to many relationships and as such is one of those special ""DNR"" spatial views ( ie. is  implemented  similar to a feature class). Column names may not match between SOILS_SV and the originating datasets.
Use limitations

This Spatial View is available to Washingotn DNR users and those with access to the Washington State Uplands IMS site.

The following cautions only apply to one-to-many and many-to-many spatial views!
Use these in the metadata only if the SV is one-to-many or many-to-many.

CAUTIONS:
Area and Length Calculations:  Use care when summarizing or totaling area or length calculations from spatial views with one-to-many or many-to-many relationships.  One-to-many or many-to-many relationships between tabular and spatial data create multiple features in the same geometry.  In other words, if there are two or more records in the table that correspond to the same feature (a single polygon, line or point), the spatial view will contain an identical copy of that feature's geometry for every corresponding record in the table.  Area and length calculations should be performed carefully, to ensure they are not being exaggerated by including copies of the same feature's geometry.

Symbolizing Spatial Features:  
Use care when symbolizing data in one-to-many or many-to-many spatial views.  If there are multiple attributes tied to the same feature, symbolizing with a solid fill may mask other important features within the spatial view.  This can be most commonly seen when symbolizing features based on a field with multiple table records.  

Labeling Spatial Features:
Spatial views with one-to-many or many-to-many relationships may present duplicate labels for those features with multiple table records.  This is because there are multiple features in the same geometry, and each one receives a label.

Identification of Population Centers enables WSDOT to address the Complete Streets requirement under RCW 47.04.035 and to otherwise identify locations prioritized in the 2021 WSDOT Active Transportation Plan (ATP). WSDOT may also recognize other developed areas as exhibiting land use patterns consistent with the definition of population center, that are not currently captured by this data layer. This data layer assists WSDOT in prioritizing active transportation improvements in areas where people congregate and access destinations, and where travel distances between destinations align with typical distances travelled by users of pedestrian and bicycle modes. These areas are a priority because they serve the broadest range of users and potential users of the transportation system, including the very young, very old, and people with disabilities. In this dataset, each Population Center includes information for the “Place Name”, the “Place Type” (city/town, Urban Growth Area outside of city limits, or Census Designated Place), and whether or not the Population Center intersects a State Route (“yes” indicates that there is an intersection with a State Route, “no” indicates that there is no intersection.).

This shapefile includes the annexation polygons that the
Office of Financial Management (OFM) has sent to the Census Bureau since March
2020 as part of the Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). The Census Bureau
uses these polygons to update Washington State’s city limits. Field names
follow Census BAS guidelines, and an outline of relevant field names is below. More
information about BAS can be found here: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/bas.html

The polygons include
the quarterly annexations and other boundary corrections that effect the Census
city boundaries, as well as several county boundary adjustments for King,
Kittitas, Pierce, Spokane, and Stevens County.
The annexation polygons were originally created by Washington’s
Department of Transportation, and then edited by OFM to align with the latest BAS
city boundary file available. These polygons to not follow the strict legal
description of the annexation, as their intent is to make clear delineations
between jurisdictions for population allocation. The following are the main
differences between BAS annexation polygons and the originals:

· The edges and vertices of polygons are snapped
first to contiguous Census city limits and then to county parcels

·
Where an annexation moves a city boundary to be
either adjacent or across a right of way, the polygon is drawn to the
centerline of the right of way

· Annexations that are only include a right of way
are often omitted, as they will not change the Census Bureau boundary

This file is updated quarterly. For questions or for data
from earlier years, please contact Nate Chase nate.chase@ofm.wa.gov.

Relevant Field Names:

·
CHNG_TYPE- Type of area update. A is
annexation, D is deannexation, and B is a boundary correction
which is a newly discovered boundary discrepancy

· Eff_date- the local effective date

· AUTHYPE- O is ordinance or resolution; X
is for boundary correction; L signifies a county boundary correction

· DOCU- the legal ordinance or resolution for the
annexation. If there is a blank, then the entry is a correction polygon.

· RELATE- Changing from in or out of jurisdiction

· JUSTIFY- OFM’s reason for submitting the change
polygon

· A_Date- this is the date that OFM approves the
annexation. OFM cannot legally approve annexations until all state requirements
are met. The approval date cannot be earlier than the effective date, but it
can be on the same day. OFM’s population determinations use the approval date
of annexations. BAS submissions are only submitted after this date.

The three GIS layers provided in this file geodatabase are the layers displayed in the POTW (Public) online map application. The three layers are scheduled to be updated on the first Monday of each month. These three GIS layers are: WDFWPHSPlusPublicLine, WDFWPHSPlusPublicPoint, and WDFWPHSPlusPublicPolygon. In these three layers, sensitive species are not shown as mapped (as a point, line, or polygon) but the locations are masked as a Section (one square mile), Quarter Township (nine square miles), or Township (thirty-six square miles) polygons. Sensitive species and habitat information are defined in WDFW Policy 5210. Priority habitats and species locations deemed sensitive by WDFW are not publicly displayed beyond a certain resolution (e.g., township or section) due to an increased risk of human interference. Sensitive data is exempt from public disclosure under the Public Records Act; this term is defined in RCW 42.56.430. Sensitive species are any wildlife species likely to become endangered or threatened; this term is defined in WAC 200-200-100. Qualifying landowners, university researchers, government agencies, and tribes may request PHS maps that contain this sensitive data. Since this GIS layer contains non-sensitive species information, it can be used without limitations, but please acknowledge the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) as the source of this information.  Please do not distribute this data, instead refer others to WDFW. If you have any questions about this layer, you can contact PHS at this email address: phsproducts@dfw.wa.gov with a subject line of the email being ""POTW Public Dataset Question"". Please note, although mapped PHS data is useful for determining the general extent of priority species or habitats, the department has not surveyed the entire state of Washington.

These oak polygons are defined by WDFW’s Priority Habitats and Species (PHS) program.","biota,environment,planning,Cadastre,oak,Oregon White Oak","The data layer consists of two types of mapped oak information.  The first is information mapped by WDFW Habitat and Wildlife biologists using their own knowledge of where oak exists, or using information providing by others.  The mapping of this first type of information tried to show locations of oak woodlands.  It is, and never attempted to be, a complete inventory of oak in Washington State. 

The second is information modeled from mapped location of oak points, mainly in Clark County but also in small areas of Cowlitz and Skamania Counties. This data layer shows where WDFW recommends counties and cities require site-specific information be gathered to inform site-scale land use decisions. WDFW intends project planners and landowners to use this data to flag where PHS-defined oak woodlands likely exist – provided that the precise boundary of the oak woodland is then determined by a qualified professional considering site-scale information. WDFW also intends for community planners to use this information when estimating potential impacts to oak woodlands of regional planning decisions (e.g., neighborhood, city, or countywide decisions such as where to expand an Urban Growth Area). This map provides WDFW’s best available science regarding the presumed, modeled location of oak woodlands.

This data layer’s primary purpose is to identify where site-specific analysis should be undertaken to inform site-scale decisions. It is a flagging tool. WDFW does not recommend this data be used in a regulatory setting for a specific location without the additional step of a qualified person verifying and fine-tuning the boundary of the oak woodland. This data layer is not designed to flag oak savannas or PHS-defined urban oak patches less than 0.75 acres. Landowners and project planners who suspect they may be dealing with an oak savanna or urban oak patch should seek assistance from WDFW’s local Habitat Biologist.

This data layer can inform site-specific analysis but should not be substituted for site-specific analysis. When using this information at a site scale, it is expected that on-the-ground conditions will vary from this map. In some instances, WDFW local Habitat Biologists can assist with a site-specific analysis – although they may be limited to an office analysis using aerial imagery rather than a field visit. Refer to WDFW’s Areas of Responsibilities Map to find out who your local Habitat Biologist is.","","Washington Department Of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), Habitat Program, Ecosystem Services, Priority Habitats and Species (PHS)","There is no limitations on who can use this data.

Dataset was generalized from a more detailed raster dataset. Includes information on vegetation type, location and areal extent. Purpose: To provide resource managers, planners and other decision-makers with information about intertidal vegetation. The data were collected as part of the Nearshore Habitat Program's mandate to map the abundance and distribution of nearshore habitats in the Puget Sound for the Puget Sound Ambient Monitoring Program (PSAMP). Supplemental_Information: (1) Washington State is divided into two State Plane zones, north and south. The data set's coordinate values are reported in Washington State Plane south. (2) Imagery was acquired during periods of maximum intertidal exposure (0 -- mean lower low water or below in most areas), and times when sun angle would reduce sun glint. (3) This dataset was generalized from the raster Intertidal Vegetation Inventory 1995. The purpose of generalization was to provide a vector-based version of the dataset with a manageable file size.

These lines were generated along the increasing state routes as represented by the 12/31/2023 WSDOT LRS. Transects were only generated within Population Centers (using the Population Centers dataset obtained from the GIS Workbench in January 2025). Every 0.01 mile (52.8 feet) along the route a transect was created perpendicular to the route extending 500 feet on each side of the route. The begin and end points of each transect were then used to generate the shortest walking route between the two points. The Route Directness Index (RDI) is a ratio that compares the straight-line (crow-flies) distance from one point to another across a barrier to the actual distance imposed by the network of paths available to a traveler. RDI data is particularly relevant to pedestrian and/or bicyclist trips due to the extra time, physical energy, and exposure to weather that out of direction travel creates. A complete discussion of route directness, including potential applications to decision making, can be found Washington State Multimodal Permeability Pilot, August 2021 [ https://wsdot.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-11/MultimodalPermeabilityPilotReport-Aug2021.pdf ]. RDI can be analyzed at different scales. A high-level analysis of RDI can address questions that compare population centers across the state or consider whether the RDI values are generally similar within a given population center or tend to vary in different portions of a population center. High level data could be combined with other statewide data such as crash data, transit stops, level of traffic stress data, destination data, etc. to analyze potential correlations. High level RDI data is less useful for analyzing a particular crossing location or recommending solutions to address high RDI values. A more detailed analysis is likely required when questions involve corridor studies or project evaluations. Detailed location information can refer to key destinations and crossing locations that are not captured using higher level network maps. The lowest RDI is 1 because a trip between those points can be made directly along an existing roadway. The actual methodology analyzed hypothetical trips where the start and end points were about a quarter mile apart relative to a straight line. In such a situation, an RDI of 2 would mean the trip is twice the distance it might otherwise be, or about one-half mile. Although one-half mile is not particularly far, the RDI is independent of the actual distance. We might start further down the road and if the RDI remained a 2 our trip distance would be twice as long as it could have been. The RDI thus measures the real or perceived burden or travel cost incurred by a person walking or bicycling.","WSDOT,DOT,Washington,State,WA,Department,Transportation,TRN,018,Open,Data,Mltmdl,Plnng","This data provides a high-level measure of the Route Directness Index (RDI) associated with potential roadway crossing activities in population centers.

These routes were generated by submitting the begin and end points of each RDI_Transect to the Esri routing service using the Walking Distance parameter. The service returns a route of the shortest pedestrian path between the two points. The search tolerance for the routing service was set to 400 feet, so that if there was no valid walking destination within 400 feet of the begin or end point, no route was calculated. The routing service is dependent on the Esri network data available when the service was accessed in January 2025. The Route Directness Index (RDI) is a ratio that compares the straight-line (crow-flies) distance from one point to another across a barrier to the actual distance imposed by the network of paths available to a traveler. RDI data is particularly relevant to pedestrian and/or bicyclist trips due to the extra time, physical energy, and exposure to weather that out of direction travel creates. A complete discussion of route directness, including potential applications to decision making, can be found in the Washington State Multimodal Permeability Pilot Report, August 2021 [ https://wsdot.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-11/MultimodalPermeabilityPilotReport-Aug2021.pdf ]. RDI can be analyzed at different scales. A high-level analysis of RDI can address questions that compare population centers across the state or consider whether the RDI values are generally similar within a given population center or tend to vary in different portions of a population center. High level data could be combined with other statewide data such as crash data, transit stops, level of traffic stress data, destination data, etc. to analyze potential correlations. High level RDI data is less useful for analyzing a particular crossing location or recommending solutions to address high RDI values. A more detailed analysis is likely required when questions involve corridor studies or project evaluations. Detailed location information can refer to key destinations and crossing locations that are not captured using higher level network maps. The lowest RDI is 1 because a trip between those points can be made directly along an existing roadway. The actual methodology analyzed hypothetical trips where the start and end points were about a quarter mile apart relative to a straight line. In such a situation, an RDI of 2 would mean the trip is twice the distance it might otherwise be, or about one-half mile. Although one-half mile is not particularly far, the RDI is independent of the actual distance. We might start further down the road and if the RDI remained a 2 our trip distance would be twice as long as it could have been. The RDI thus measures the real or perceived burden or travel cost incurred by a person walking or bicycling.","WSDOT,DOT,Washington,State,WA,Department,Transportation,TRN,018,Open,Data,Mltmdl,Plnng","This data provides a high-level measure of the Route Directness Index (RDI) associated with potential roadway crossing activities in population centers.

Contact Washington State Department of Natural Resources (WA DNR)  Engineering Division Alexandra Washburn Alexandra.Washburn@dnr.wa.gov Updating Efforts Updating and editing efforts are primarily focused on roads in DNR managed state lands, adjunct roads or in areas that are covered by a published map that is undergoing an update. The original road lines were entered primarily by digitizing from paper maps, scanning by machine, or derived stereoscopically from black and white photo imagery. They are currently updated and corrected as needed, in most cases using on-line, geo-referenced orthophotography, stereo color imagery, GPS or field survey. Roads on DNR Lands should be edited frequently by division staff. Roads outside of DNR Lands are probably edited much less frequently.   The group in mapping that did this, does not do it anymore. Attributes The ROAD layer includes basic attributes that are linked to the intersection-based road segments. These attributes store information about route id, road name, road number, control, responsibility, status, access, surface, classification, and abandonment. Purpose This layer is used to help in road infrastructure planning and maintenance, Forest Practices and Road Maintenance and Abandonment Planning (RMAP) compliance reporting, forest management, timber sales planning, and is the basis for the ROAD_ROUTE_FT layer and associated event tables that currently record these maintenance activities and road easements. It is widely used as a layer in cartographic presentations and published maps.","DNR,WA,Washington Department of Natural Resources,Washington,Department of Natural Resources,Active Roads,Roads,Transp,Proprietary Roads,Transportation","The Active Roads feature class records the location and attributes of DNR managed roads.

database, but funding to complete that statewide project was not made available
at the time.

In 2009, the Federal Government outlined the need for trails
database schema in their Data Standards Review Committee, stressing the
efficiency in management decisions that a streamlined database can provide.

“The collection, storage and management of trail related
data are important components of everyday business activities in many federal
and state land-managing agencies, trail organizations and businesses. From a
management perspective, trails data must often mesh closely with other types of
infrastructure, resource and facility enterprise data.”

In 2014, the Washington State Office of the Chief Information
Officer's (OCIO) Geospatial Program Office acquired a Nonhighway and Off-Road Vehicle
Activities (NOVA) Program grant through the Washington State Recreation and
Conservation Office (RCO) giving the OCIO initial funding to develop a
statewide trails database based on Federal Geographic Data Committee standards.
Using the same standard for all trails data will allow land managers and
recreational users throughout the state to access and use the data regardless
of administrative boundary.

""Data standards will make it easier for trail
information to be accessed and exchanged and used by more than one individual
agency or group…Ease in sharing data increases the capability for enhanced and
consistent mapping, inventory, monitoring, conditions assessment, maintenance,
costing, budgeting, information retrieval, and summary reporting for internal
and external needs.”

Along with streamlining data and facilitating efficiency in
management practices across agencies, the database will provide a source of
trails information that is open and free to the public. The 2016 State Legislature provided additional funding from the
Nonhighway and Off-road Vehicle Activities Account to the Office of the Chief
Information Officer to continue work on the database.

Additional details about the project can be found here:

The 2013-15 Capital Budget, Chapter 19, Laws of 2013, Section 3174, (ESSB 5035) has tasked the Recreation and Conservation Office (RCO) to provide a centralized inventory of lands in Washington owned by federal, state and local governments, and by Native American tribes. This work is to be undertaken in collaboration with the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee (JLARC).  

The proviso stipulates that the inventory must:
•	Be in a web-accessible format, including a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based interactive map that allows users to find out information about specific aspects of land ownership. The data must be standardized to allow summary information to be accessible. 
•	Include the following information: 
o	Ownership (federal; state, by state agency; local government; and tribal); 
o	Ownership type (fee simple or easements); 
o	Location; 
o	Acreage; 
o	Principal use of these lands (intended use at the time of acquisition and current use) including, but not limited to, developed recreation land, habitat and passive recreation land, and revenue-generation uses; and 
o	Acquisition costs if acquired by state agencies over the last ten years, including acquisition funding sources.

In addition, RCO shall develop recommendations for standardization of acquisition and disposal recordkeeping on a biennial basis, including identifying a preferred process for centralizing acquisition data. 

Key dates are January 1, 2014, when a status report on the inventory to the appropriate committees of the Legislature is due, and July 1, 2014, when the project must be complete and a final report is due.

The inventory is a key component for a three-part review of public lands that the Legislature tasked to JLARC in capital budget proviso 1001. The JLARC review is due December 1, 2014.","Acquisition,Grant,Project,Funding,Washington State (WA),Recreation and Conservation Office (RCO),Public Lands Inventory (PLI)","The WA RCO Funded Land Acquisitions layer shows the point location and several attributes of all land acquisition grant projects funded through the Washington State Recreation and Conservation Office.

These habitats provide the critical resources that ferruginous hawks require for successful nesting: medium-sized mammalian prey, low substrate suitable for nest placement, and space that isolates it from disturbance. Their breeding habitat in Washington most often occurs in shrubsteppe and juniper savanna. These areas are especially important as ferruginous hawk habitat when occupied by native mammalian prey and when there are basalt rock outcrops or isolated trees, primarily juniper, to provide suitable substrate for supporting nests (Bowles and Decker 1931, Bechard et al. 1990, WDFW 1996). Degradation or conversion of shrubsteppe and grassland often results in reduction or removal of the critical resources required for ferruginous hawk nesting. Recent attempts at habitat restoration for ferruginous hawks in southeast Washington through the Conservation Reserve Program have been effective in re-establishing hawks in degraded habitats. Ferruginous hawks build their nests on natural and artificial objects that are often short structures, or they build their nests on the ground (Ng et al. 2020). In Washington, ferruginous hawks construct nests away from human activity. Breeding habitat consists of natural vegetation or agricultural cover types like pasture. The breeding habitat can be divided into three areas, the Core Area (3.2 kilometers around a nest site), the Home Range (10 kilometers around a nest site), and the zone for suitable habitat (to to 20 kilometers around nest sites occupied in the past 5 years).  The Core Area consists of suitable habitat and potentially non-habitat both of which provide a disturbance buffer. The 10-km distance approximates the radius of a circular breeding home range of a ferruginous hawk (378 km2) in the Columbia Basin (Watson et al. 2023). This distance is doubled to define the 10-20 km zone for suitable habitat, which also approximates the maximum nearest-neighbor distance for nesting ferruginous hawks (i.e., 7.2 km) in studies reviewed by Olendorff (1993).

With 90% certainty, at least 1 in 10 parcels will have soil arsenic at or above levels shown. Predictions are based on distance and direction from the former Asarco smelter, and on sampling data from forested and other soils undisturbed by development. Actual arsenic levels may vary greatly from parcel to parcel. Disclaimer: Actual arsenic levels may vary greatly from parcel to parcel. Property-specific sampling is necessary to determine the actual amount of arsenic on a given property. How to Sample your own soil - https://ecology.wa.gov/Spills-Cleanup/Contamination-cleanup/Dirt-Alert-program/Soil-sampling Pattern and Description of the Tacoma Smelter Plume: There are three major factors to Arsenic deposition (the three D's) but many others exist. 'D'irection- wind rose direction,'D'istance, 'D'isturbance Arsenic tends to exceed state cleanup levels more often than other metals. Lead is the other main contaminant. Arsenic and lead are found mainly in the top six inches of soil. In areas where soil has been moved or turned over, contamination can be deeper. Undisturbed areas, such as forests, tend to have higher levels of contamination. In general, levels are related to distance and direction from the former smelter. Levels decrease with distance and are higher along the dominant north-northeast and south-southwest wind directions. Created a dataset for arsenic(0 to 6 inches sample depth) that had similar study characteristics in the field and lab. Various environmental studies were reviewed because of the size of the study area. Ecology reviewed data from over 130 studies and found 23 studies that had applicable data. Theses studies contained over 22,500 disturbed-residential samples and 1469 undisturbed samples for our analysis.","Washington State Department of Ecology,ECY,Toxic Cleanup Program,TCP,ENV,environment,007,arsenic,ASARCO,Tacoma,Tacoma Smelter Plume,environment,Ruston,Tacoma,Vashon Island,Maury Island,pollution,toxics","Depiction of potential arsenic contamination in the Puget Sound region due to the ASARCO smelter.  

Asarco’s copper smelter operated for almost 100 years in Ruston, Washington, a small town within the borders of the City of Tacoma. The Tacoma smelter opened in 1890 as a lead smelter. Asarco purchased it in 1905 and converted it to a copper smelter. In 1912, the company added arsenic recovery facilities.  The Tacoma smelter specialized in processing ores with high arsenic levels.  

A large smokestack dispersed arsenic and lead across a wide area. Asarco released smelter emissions through a smokestack. The company replaced the original smokestack in 1917 with a 571 foot stack. Air emissions from the plant traveled with the wind and settled onto soils across more than 1,000 square miles of the Puget Sound Basin. Metals in the emissions, mainly arsenic and lead, settled on the surface soils. The smelter closed in 1986.","/Categories/Spills and Cleanup,/Categories/Waste and Toxics,/Categories/Monitoring and Sites","Dr. Pierre Goovaerts and Washington Department of Ecology(Ian Mooser)

This data was also intended to inform high-level prioritization of active transportation improvements. LTS data rank highway segments from 1 to 4 based on roadway characteristics like posted speed, vehicle volume, number of travel lanes, and presence of active transportation infrastructure like sidewalks and bike lanes. WSDOT deemed LTS 1 suitable for all ages and abilities. LTS 2 is considered suitable for most active travelers. LTS 3 and 4 represent functional gaps in active transportation networks that present systemic safety issues and likely deter use of active modes. The data reports a Pedestrian Level of Traffic Stress (PLTS) and Bicycle Level of Traffic Stress (BLTS) based on the presence of mode-specific infrastructure and calculated using guidance from the WSDOT Design Manual, updated September 2024. PLTS is calculated using Exhibits 1520-1 and 1520-2 based on the presence of sidewalks recorded in WSDOT enterprise sidewalk data and presence and width of a paved shoulder recorded in the State Highway Log Roadway Data Shoulders dataset. BLTS is calculated using Exhibits 1520-5, 1520-6, and 1520-7 based on the presence and width of bike lanes recorded in the State Highway Log Special Use Lanes dataset. Data is not currently available on presence of separation materials, so bike lanes were only considered based on their width. The General LTS measure is based on Exhibit 1520-5. Ramp segments are included in the dataset with a default LTS ranking of 999. This ranking indicates that all ramps are to be considered high LTS (3 or 4) unless a manual evaluation of the roadway characteristics indicates otherwise. Datasets were not available that would enable ramp rankings to be determined systematically based on posted speed, traffic volume, and number of travel lanes, however a manual review of many ramp configurations across the state indicated that most ramps present LTS concerns. The data provided is not a substitute for detailed investigation of a location when specific investment decisions are being considered. The specific characteristics of locations with the same LTS rankings could vary considerably. It is important to note that an LTS 1 or 2 location might have additional, unmeasured characteristics that reduce its presumed suitability for active travel.

The Statewide Washington Integrated Fish Distribution (SWIFD) dataset is a single National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) event layer for the state of Washington. Within the Treaty Tribes and Washington State co-management area, the Northwest Indian Fisheries (NWIFC) and Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) collaborated to create a single data schema and to combine fish distribution data. The NWIFC and WDFW combined data area is within the boundaries of Washington State Water Resource Inventory Areas (WRIA) 01 -- 23. This is the western Washington region including the western Washington Cascades, the Puget Sound, the Hood Canal, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and the Olympic peninsula from the Nooksack River in the north (WRIA 01) to the Chehallis River (WRIA 22/23) in the South. The data schema remains the same for Washington state fish distribution data outside of the co-management area, but all fish distribution data outside of the co-management area is supplied by WDFW. The foundational fish distribution dataset is an event table that contains attributes for each species of fish, anadromous and resident, that have previously been mapped by either NWIFC or WDFW. This event layer maps to the ROUTED 1:24,000-scale version of NHD for Washington state, using NHD ReachCodes as the route identifier, and relative 0-100 linear measures within each reach/route. SWIFD events are in the USGS Hydrologic Event Management (HEM, http://nhd.usgs.gov/tools.html#hem) table format and HEM is used to update and maintain the event tables. Each individual fsh species/run contains information on verification of the upper extent of fish distribution, life history, and habitat use. In the final dataset all the individual fish species/run distributions are stacked onto the NHD reaches, so a given stream reach with 6 unique species/runs will have 6 features associated with it. Usually a definition query is applied to this featureclass to display a single species at a time. The event table structure of the dataset does allow groups of species/runs to be integrated via the use of event overlays. Users should also pay attention to the DISTTYPE_DESC field to ensure they are displaying the appropriate records for their purposes. In particular, there are confirmed absence records for certain species that should not be displayed as occupied stream habitat. SWIFD is developed by dissolving the foundational NHD ReachCode event table SWIFD_2HEM_evts by the LLID and the specific fish record attributes: LLID;LLID_STRM_NAME;SPECRCODE;SPECIESRUN;SPECCODE;SPECIES;RUN_TIME;RUNTIME_DESC;DIST_TYPE;DISTTYPE_DESC;USE_TYPE;USETYPE_DESC;LIFE_HIST;LIFEHIST_DESC;","Linear events,NHD 24K Routes,WRIA Watersheds,HUC-8 Watersheds,Olympic Coast,Olympic Mountains,Strait of Juan De Fuca,Hood Canal,Puget Sound,Cascade Mountains,Columbia River,Estuary,Freshwater,Benthic,Lotic,River,Stream,Lake,Fish,Salmon,Resident,Anadromous","Updated data and metadata on 2024-08-19 for NWIFC proposals.

SWIFD is the Statewide Washington Integrated Fish Distribution, presented as a linear featureclass based on WA single stream identifiers (LLID). SWIFD includes anadromous and resident salmonids, and various game fish. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) manages a GIS fish distribution (presence) dataset for the entire state of Washington. Within the Treaty Tribes and Washington state co-management area of western Washington, the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission (NWIFC) and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) have collaborated to consolidate fish distribution (presence) data and to co-steward that dataset moving forward. To consolidate data within the co-management area, NWIFC and WDFW had to update their respective data management schemas to create a new schema that accepts data from each organization. The primary purpose of creating a single fish distribution dataset for the state of Washington is to create a common data framework for fish information that better serves the management, conservation and restoration of the state's fish habitat and fishery resources.","","Chris Clark, Christina Gonzales, Bruce Jones, Ron McFarlance, and Tyson Waldo from NWIFC; Arleta Agun, Brody Cox, and Andrew Weiss from WDFW; Anita Stohr  from Washington State Department of Ecology; and Keith Dublanca from the Washington State Recreation and Conservation Office all had key roles in this project.","The dataset is open for public consumption.

This subset includes only waterbodies that are classified as lake/ponds ,reservoirs, or estuaries and that are > 1 sqKm (10763900 sqft). The NHD is a national framework for assigning reach addresses to water-related entities, such as industrial discharges, drinking water supplies, fish habitat areas, wild and scenic rivers. Reach addresses establish the locations of these entities relative to one another within the NHD surface water drainage network, much like addresses on streets. Once linked to the NHD by their reach addresses, the upstream/downstream relationships of these water-related entities--and any associated information about them--can be analyzed using software tools ranging from spreadsheets to geographic information systems (GIS). GIS can also be used to combine NHD-based network analysis with other data layers, such as soils, land use and population, to help understand and display their respective effects upon one another.

The NHD dataset has been adopted as the Washington State hydrography standard. The NHD is a national framework for assigning reach addresses to water-related entities, such as industrial discharges, drinking water supplies, fish habitat areas, wild and scenic rivers. Reach addresses establish the locations of these entities relative to one another within the NHD surface water drainage network, much like addresses on streets. Once linked to the NHD by their reach addresses, the upstream/downstream relationships of these water-related entities--and any associated information about them--can be analyzed using software tools ranging from spreadsheets to geographic information systems (GIS). GIS can also be used to combine NHD-based network analysis with other data layers, such as soils, land use and population, to help understand and display their respective effects upon one another. Furthermore, because the NHD provides a nationally consistent framework for addressing and analysis, water-related information linked to reach addresses by one organization (national, state, local) can be shared with other organizations and easily integrated into many different types of applications to the benefit of all. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:4,800 scale. Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. This map contains a BETA version of WaterType attached to the Skagit River Basin NHDflowlines.  This Beta version of the Watertype is the result of a pilot project and will be refined over the next six months. The field is for users of NHD who want access to Water Type and who are not under Forest Practices rules.

evaluation of riparian forests depends on precise delineation of both bank to
bank (active channel) and single-thread hydrography. Local land use and salmon recovery planners use
hydrography as a reliable tool for understanding and managing watershed impacts
across the state. Active channel mapping
allows practitioners to delineate riparian zones, examine the shading effects
of riparian vegetation, map the location, extent, and distribution of
anadromous and resident fish as well as locate fish blocking culverts, map
protective stream buffers, and accurately inventory existing hydrography (Hyatt
et al, 2022). The manual provided in this package describes methods and procedures used to digitize active channel
polygons from high resolution elevation data and high-resolution imagery. Methods like this have become necessary, as
access to high resolution data has become easier. Included in this method is AC Tools, a
Python script-based ArcGIS Pro Toolset that can be used to delineate channel
bank and channel island contour lines along river mainstems and larger
tributaries. Much of the method involves
how to select those contours and create active channel polygons. Methods are also available for download at https://pspwa.box.com/s/3stokaav635odvd8k2dtkcigef5sbkr2 Pilot results of this methodology were conducted in Stillaguamish, Queets, and the Entiat River, and are available at the Puget Sound Partnerships Spatial Data Hub.

Active
Channel Hydrography The
“active channel” includes the wetted channels of rivers and streams as well as
adjacent un-vegetated cobble and gravel bars that are inundated during high
flows. In this method, the active channel is analogous to the “bankfull channel”
(Leopold and Maddock 1953, Leopold et al 1964, Williams
1978) or the ordinary high-water mark line (OHWM),
where the presence and action of waters are “so common and usual, and so long
continued in ordinary years as to mark upon the soil or vegetation a character
distinct from the abutting upland,”(WAC 220-660-030(111)). In places where this
line cannot the delineated the ordinary high water line is delineated along the
elevation of the mean annual flood for every three years.

There
are many reasons for considering the boundary of the active channel network. A common
use for delineating the active channel is to map the inner edge of the riparian
zone (eg. Hyatt 2023). Riparian areas are transitional areas between land
and aquatic ecosystems that include both lotic and lentic systems (Gregory et
al, 1991). These zones can include the
surface and subsurface water influences and human induced natural forces,
understanding the active channel boundary thereby isn’t just important for
managing fish populations and identifying habitat restoration sites, it is also
important for land use planning and management.","Active Channel,Boundaries (BND),puget sound (ps),puget sound partnership (psp),Washington (WA),statewide,riparian,hydrography","This script package was developed in 2023 for statewide application to delineate active channel polygons for riparian monitoring.

SWIFD includes anadromous and resident salmonids, and various game fish. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) manages a GIS fish distribution (presence) dataset for the entire state of Washington. Within the Treaty Tribes and Washington state co-management area of western Washington, the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission (NWIFC) and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) have collaborated to consolidate fish distribution (presence) data and to co-steward that dataset moving forward. To consolidate data within the co-management area, NWIFC and WDFW had to update their respective data management schemas to create a new schema that accepts data from each organization. The primary purpose of creating a single fish distribution dataset for the state of Washington is to create a common data framework for fish information that better serves the management, conservation and restoration of the state's fish habitat and fishery resources.","","","The dataset is open for public consumption.

Surveyors relied on descriptions from the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (WADNR) late-seral forested plant associations of the Puget Lowland (Chappell 2005), freshwater wetland vegetation (Kunze 1994), and intertidal vegetation (Kunze and Cornelius 1982) to make final vegetation community assignments. In some cases, the WADNR descriptions were not adequate in describing existing vegetation associations. In these cases, alternative vegetation communities or plant associations were created by PBI. Remote sensing techniques consisted of manually delineating plant associations or mosaics of plant associations in a digital environment. Orthorectified aerial photography and LANDSAT Thematic Mapper satellite images were reviewed for discernable vegetation or landform patterns. When available, we also high-resolution true color orthorectified aerial photography was also used. Topographic maps, digital elevation models (DEMs), and light detection and ranging imagery (LIDAR) were also employed (where available) to assist the process of vegetation community delineation. The vegetation polygons were created by hand in GIS by ocular assessment. Field surveys consisted of visiting sites located within the vegetation polygons created during the remote sensing process. At representative sites within a polygon, vegetation data and site descriptions were recorded in a fashion consistent with the plant community polygon format. Further refinements and editing of the initial vegetation polygon layers were done by hand on hard copy maps in the field, and later edited digitally in GIS to create the final vegetation polygon layer.","Vegetation,VegPolys,Vegetation Surveys,Vegetation Communities,Environment,Environmental,Conservation,Washington State Parks,WA State Parks,WSPRC,PARKS,Biota,BIO,Ecology,Flora","The WSPRC Vegetation survey database is derived from various field studies conducted from 2006 to 2022 in Washington State Parks by Pacific Biodiversity Institute (PBI) and others on behalf of Washington State Parks & Recreation Commission.","","Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission (WSPRC) and Pacific Biodiversity Institute (PBI).","Liability Disclaimer: The Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission (WSPRC) provides these geographic data ""as is""; WSPRC makes no guarantee or warranty concerning the accuracy of information contained in the geographic data.

The form of the PM2.5 design value is the 3-year average of the annual 98th percentile 24-hour average concentrations. These areas were identified using a combination of model output from the Air Indicator Report for Public Awareness and Community Tracking (AIRPACT-4) forecast model and measured PM2.5 concentrations at monitoring sites operated by Ecology and its partner agencies. All input datasets cover the time period July 2014 – June 2017, which was the most recent continuous 3-year period available with minimal wildfire influence. Wildfire data were not removed completely from the dataset; rather, data were chosen and filtered to minimize the influence of wildfires due to inconsistent model performance and extreme outliers during wildfire periods. Design values were interpolated using the following steps: Median daily AIRPACT-4 forecast PM2.5 concentrations were extracted at 4km grid cell centroids. The ratio between the measured 98th percentile PM2.5 concentration (as a surrogate for the 24-hour design value) and the nearest grid cell's median daily AIRPACT-4 forecast PM2.5 concentration was calculated for each monitoring site. The ratios were interpolated across the domain at 4km resolution using Empirical Bayesian Kriging. Interpolated ratios were multiplied by median daily AIRPACT-4 forecast PM2.5 concentrations to yield interpolated PM2.5 design values. Grid cells with design values above Ecology's healthy air goal of 20 µg/m^3 were extracted and dissolved into smoothed polygons. Only polygons with ≥3 contiguous grid cells were retained due to model uncertainty in small areas. Polygons were overlaid with city, census-designated place, and urban growth area boundaries from 2020 Census TIGER/Line files. Where polygons intersected with any of the above census-defined boundaries, the largest of the intersecting boundaries defines the designated area.

Purpose: The Rain-on-snow coverage was created as a screening tool to identify forest practice applications that may be in a significant rain-on-snow zone (WAC 222-22-100). Description: Five ROS zones are defined in Washington State and are based on climate, elevation, latitude, and vegetation. Rain on snow is a process that exhibits spatial and temporal variation under natural conditions, with the effects of vegetation on snow accumulation and melt adding additional complications in prediction. There is no map that shows the magnitude and frequency of water inputs to be expected from rain on snow events, so we have attempted to create an index map based on what we know about the process controls and their effects in the various climatic zones. If we assume that, averaged over many years, the seasonal storm tracks that bring warm, wet cyclonic storms to the Northwest have access to all parts of Washington , then the main factors controlling and/or reflecting the occurrence and magnitude of a R/S event in any particular place are: 1) Climatic region: especially the differences between windward and leeward sides of major mountain ranges, which control seasonal climatic patterns; 2) Elevation: controls temperature, thus the likelihood and amount of snow on the ground, and affects orographic enhancement of storm precipitation; 3) Latitude: affects temperature, thus snow; 4) Aspect: affects insolation and temperature (especially in winter), thus melting of snow; 5) Vegetation: the species composing forest communities can reflect the climate of an area (tolerance of warmth or cold, wet or dry conditions, deep and/or long lived snowpacks); the height and density of vegetation also partly controls the amount of snow on the ground. As natural vegetation integrates the effects of all of these controls, we tried to find or adapt floral indicators of the various zones of water input. We designed the precipitation zones to reflect the amount of snow likely to be on the ground at the beginning of a storm. We assumed that some middle elevation area would experience the greatest water input due to Rain on Snow, because the amount of snow available would be likely to be approximately the amount that could be melted. Higher and lower elevation zones would bear diminished effects, but for opposite reasons (no snow to melt, vs too cold to melt much). These considerations suggested a three or five zone system. We chose to designate five zones because a larger number of classes reduces the importance of the dividing lines, and thus of the inherent uncertainties of those lines. The average snow water equivalents (SWE) for the early January measurements at about 100 snow courses and snow pillows were compiled; snow depths for the first week in January at about 85 weather stations were converted into SWE. For each region (western North Cascades, Blue Mountains, etc.), the snow amounts were sorted by station elevation to derive a rough indicator of the relationship between snow accumulation and elevation. (Sub regional differences in snow accumulation patterns were also recognized.) After trying various combinations of ratios for areas where the snow hydrology is relatively well known, we adopted the following designations: 5. Highlands: >4 5 times ideal SWE; high elevation, with little likelihood of significant water input to the ground during storms (precipitation likely to be snow, and liquid water probably refreezes in a deep snow pack); effects of harvest on snow accumulation are minor; 4. Snow dominated zone: from ""1.25 1.5 ideal SWE, up to ""4; melt occurs during R/S (especially during early season storms), but effects can be mitigated by the lag time of percolation through the snowpack; 3. Peak rain on snow zone: ""0.5 0.75 up to ""1.25 ideal SWE; middle elevations: shallow snow packs are common in winter, so likelihood and effects of R/S in heavy rainstorms are greatest; typically more snow accumulation in clearings than in forest; 2. Rain dominated zone: ""0.1 0.5 ideal SWE; areas at lower elevations, where rain occasionally falls on small amounts of snow; 1. Lowlands: <0.1 ideal SWE; coastal, low elevation, and rain shadow areas; lower rainfall intensities, and significant snow depths are rare. Precipitation zones were mapped on mylar overlays on 1:250,000 scale topographic maps. Because snow depth is affected by many factors, the correlation between snow and elevation is crude, and it was not possible to simply pick out contour markers for the boundaries. Ranges of elevations were chosen for each region, but allowance was made for the effects of sub regional climates, aspect, vegetative indicators of snow depth, etc. Thus, a particular boundary would be mapped somewhat lower on the north side of a ridge or in a cool valley (e.g. below a glacier), reflecting greater snow accumulations in such places. The same boundary would be mapped higher on the south side of the ridge, where inter-storm sunshine could reduce snow accumulation. Conditions at the weather stations and snow courses were used to check the mapping; but in areas where measurements are scarce, interpolation had to be performed. The boundaries of the precipitation zones were entered in the DNR's GIS. Because of the small scale of the original mapping and the imprecision of the digitizing process, some errors were introduced. It should not be expected that GIS images can be projected to large scales to define knife edge zone boundaries (which don't exist, anyway), but they are good enough to locate areas tens of acres in size. Some apparent anomalies in the map require explanation. Much of western Washington is mapped in the lowland or highland zones. This does not mean that R/S does not occur in those areas; it does, but on average with less frequency and hydrologic significance than in the middle three zones. Most of central and eastern Washington is mapped in the rain dominated zone, despite meager precipitation there; this means only that the amount of snow likely to be on the ground is small, and storm water inputs are composed dominantly of the rain itself, without much contribution from snow melt. Much of northeastern Washington is mapped in the peak Rain Snow zone, despite the fact that such events are less common there than in western Washington. This is due to the fact that there is less increase in snow depth with elevation (i.e. the snow wedge is less steep), so a wider elevation band has appropriate snow amounts; plus, much of that region lies within that elevation band where the 'ideal' amount of snow is liable to be on the ground when a model Rain Snow event occurs. This does not reflect the lower frequency of such storms in that area.","climatology,climate,snow,rain,weather","Rain on Snow is a statewide coverage of rain-on-snow zones.

FHWA Directive 23 CFR 470 states that the State transportation agency has the primary responsibility for developing and updating a statewide highway functional classification in rural and urban areas to determine functional usage of the existing roads and streets. The State transportation agency is to cooperate with responsible local officials, or appropriate Federal agency in the case of areas under Federal jurisdiction, in developing and updating the functional classification. The results of the functional classification is to be mapped and submitted to FHWA for approval and when approved serve as the official record for Federal-aid highways and the basis for designation of the National Highway System. Functional classification is the grouping of highways, roads and streets by the character of service they provide and was developed for transportation planning purposes. Basic to this process is the recognition that individual routes do not serve travel independently in any major way. Rather, most travel involves movement through a network of roads. Comprehensive transportation planning, an integral part of total economic and social development, uses functional classification to determine how travel can be channelized within the network in a logical and efficient manner. Functional classification defines the part that any particular route should play in serving the flow of trips through a highway network. The Washington State Legislature in RCW 47.05.021 and the Federal-Aid Highway Act direct the WSDOT to analyze the entire state highway system to ""subdivide"", classify, and sub-classify all designated state highways according to their function and importance.

Results consist of three types of outcomes: Bridge Damage Levels and Types, Bridge Repair Types, and Bridge Reopening Times. All output is a part of this feature class. Bridge damage types are projected on the basis of both damage level (None, Moderate, Significant), whether a bridge is a special bridge type, and also the types of damage that the bridge will experience (including both direct seismic and secondary earthquake-induced impacts); The projected repair types and reopening times necessary to bring bridges back to a minimum level of functionality that enables their use for emergency response were computed using the methodology specified in the Bridge Reopening Times section. Refer to the BSST Technical Report. The BSST was developed to assess the potential impacts of a CSZ earthquake to highway bridges in Washington State at a system-level as part of the Washington State Transportation Systems RRAP project. The results provided identify the Damage Levels, Damage Types, Repair Types and Reopening Times associated with 2,717 bridges located in Western and Central Washington that were evaluated for this RRAP project. Understanding that this analysis likely constitutes a “worst-case scenario” with respect to bridge damage, the results nonetheless project that the majority of bridges in Washington State will experience moderate to significant damage resulting from a CSZ earthquake. While the majority of bridges that experience damage could be reopened within one year of the earthquake, a substantial number of those bridges (28.7 percent) are projected to take more than a year to reopen—in many cases 2 or more years. The results also project that while many bridges may be reopened after either minor repairs/inspections or the construction of a temporary bypass road, a substantial number of more significantly damaged bridges (797 structures) span bodies of water and will require complete replacement prior to reopening. This suggests that significant gains in roadway corridor reopening times could be gained by focusing on retrofits or upgrades to these more vulnerable bridges that span rivers and other bodies of water. This tool is primarily intended to inform regional highway prioritization for emergency response activities; however, the BSST provides a useful evaluation methodology that could be applied to other regional emergency preparedness and infrastructure assessment studies. This could include studies of bridge infrastructure to other potential seismic events within the region, or at varying jurisdictional levels (i.e., county, local). The BSST also uses currently available seismic, seismically-induced secondary hazard and infrastructure information. As new seismic information becomes available, or as secondary-hazards (e.g., landslides, avalanches) become characterized more comprehensively, such information could be integrated into the current BSST methodology. Similarly, as seismic retrofit activities or other infrastructure improvement projects continue throughout Washington State, or as new infrastructure are built, it will be important that the infrastructure data integrated in the BSST also be updated periodically. Doing so will ensure that planners and infrastructure managers maintain the most current and complete understanding of the network-level seismic risks of a CSZ event to Washington State highways.Please note that all results from the BSST are based on a model and information received from WSDOT. Damages from an earthquake may be different that what is provided here. Liquefaction data was used within the BSST tool. WADNR is the source for liquefaction data and is available here: https://www.dnr.wa.gov/programs-and-services/geology/geologic-hazards/geologic-hazard-maps#nehrp-site-class-and-liquefaction-susceptibilityUSGS ShakeMap was also used in the BSST tool for a M9.0 Cascadia earthquake and is available here: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/scenarios/eventpage/gllegacycasc9p0expanded_se/shakemap/pga. DHS distributed this data to WSDOT on August 22, 2019.","Transportation,Washington,WA,Bridge,State,DOT,Department,Emergency Management,Resiliency,Apps","The Regional Resiliency Assessment Program (RRAP) is a cooperative assessment of specific critical infrastructure within a designated geographic area and a regional analysis of the surrounding infrastructure that addresses a range of infrastructure resilience issues that could have regionally and nationally significant consequences. In 2017, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) sponsored the Washington State Transportation Systems RRAP project in coordination with the Washington Emergency Management Division (EMD), Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), and other regional stakeholders. This project is focused on assessing the impacts of a Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) earthquake on state transportation systems and, in particular, how those impacts may affect the ability of emergency response efforts to move supplies into the region. The intended outcome of this analysis is the prioritization of transportation routes and modes for additional planning, investment, hardening, or other activities to enhance their resilience—and therefore, to enhance their ability to support response and recovery efforts following a CSZ earthquake. An important part of this transportation system-level assessment has been to assess the seismic vulnerability of the state highway system. In doing so, the RRAP project team developed a Bridge Seismic Screening Tool (BSST) to assess, at a system-level, the potential impacts that a CSZ earthquake could have on state highway bridges. The first step in the BSST is to assess the seismic vulnerability of highway bridge infrastructure in Washington State following a CSZ earthquake to determine a projected or potential damage state. Damage states are then used to determine approximate reopening times for bridge crossings.","","Washington State Department of Transportation","For Planning use only.

Level of service standard for ferry routes is based on the Washington State Department of Transportation Ferries Divison Final Long Range Plan (Published June 30, 2009). The plan outlines two levels of LOS standards by route and season. In general, standards are higher in the summer months to reflect additional recreational ridership on all routes. Standards are higher on recreational routes to reflect an increased feasibility of spreading ridership to under-utilized sailings. The two standards outlined by the plan are: Standard 1 serves as an indicator of when WSF might consider more targeted, route-specific strategies to alleviate congestion and spread demand to other sailings where capacity exists. This standard should not be viewed as a minimum criterion to be achieved before adaptive management strategies are deployed (i.e. strategies that have systemwide benefits should be considered no matter what a route's performance against the LOS standard is.) Standard 2 serves as as an indicator that identifies when existing assets are being used most effectively and WSF might begin considering additional investment.

These ranks were developed for the state highway system by 1-mile highway segment. The Ecological Stewardship rank reflects a highway segment’s overlap with the ranges of select Endangered or Threatened wildlife and its proximity to connected networks of habitat identified by the Washington Habitat Connectivity Working Group. The listed species selected for inclusion in the ranking process were those species known to be most affected by highways, either due to road mortality or behavioral avoidance or both. Lacking overlap with listed species’ ranges, a base score could still be given to highway segments that overlapped an area of high landscape integrity as identified by the Washington Habitat Connectivity Working Group (WHCWG). If a base score for any of these factors was assigned, rank values were then subject to multipliers for traffic volume and nearby blocks of public land. Highways that carry greater traffic volumes generally have a greater harmful effect on wildlife, both in terms of mortality and the barrier effect caused by behavioral avoidance. Protected lands (many public lands and private lands held in preserves or under protective easements) tend to offer a stable habitat base into the distant future and WSDOT investments in durable infrastructure are more likely to have long term benefits where public lands are present on one or both sides of the highway. The Safety Rank is a reflection of carcass removal and wildlife collision rates or simple overlap with the range of one of Washington’s larger wild animals. Identified carcass removal or collision problem areas were given higher numerical ranks than areas within the ranges of species but without a documented problem. The Maximum Rank is simply the highest of the other two ranks. Rankings updated in January 2018.","WSDOT,DOT,Washington,State,WA,Department,Transportation,TRN,018,Open,Data,Plnng,Biota,Envrnmnt","The Habitat Connectivity Investment Priorities layer establishes High, Medium, and Low priority ranks for Ecological Stewardship and Wildlife-related Safety for the entire state highway system, by one mile segment, for consideration in Corridor Planning, Environmental Retrofit project identification, and Safety and Mobility projects.","/Categories/Environment,/Categories/Planning","Washington State Department of Transportation","For Planning use only.

WSDOT applied the model using scenario planning in a series of statewide workshops, using local experts, to create qualitative assessment of climate vulnerability on its assets in each region and mode across Washington. For the purposes of this statewide effort, managed assets were defined as sections of highway or railroad, and whole facilities (Ferry Terminal or Airport). Fourteen workshops engaged experts across all WSDOT regions, state ferries, rail, and aviation. The outcome of each workshop was a subjective evaluation of asset vulnerability agreed upon by participants. This feature class contains the results for state routes. This study assumed 100% probability of climate change impacts previously identified in the University of Washington Climate Impacts Group's 2009 assessment. Types of impacts discussed in the workshops with local experts included: temperature changes, increase in extreme weather events, precipitation changes, sea level rise, fire risk, and high winds. The scientific community's understanding of climate impacts continues to evolve as the models and collective understanding of feedback systems improve. We do not have perfect information about exactly how, when, where, and to what magnitude climate changes will unfold in Washington State. After reviewing the extreme weather events and other impacts projected for their area, workshop participants defined sections of highway, rail, or specific facilities with consideration of the local geology, natural and constructed drainage and hydrology, elevation, slope, land use and operational maintenance issues.

Each Block Group receives a score based on several factors related to vulnerable populations and environmentally burdened communities, and these scores are added together to create the final score. See the accompanying methodology word document for a full list of factors. Original data sources are the U.S. Census 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) and the Washington Environmental Health Disparities (EHD) Map. Individual scores are calculated for each measure, which then sum up to aggregate scores for vulnerable populations and overburdened communities as well as a combined final score. Block Group scores based on demographic measures from the ACS data are calculated relative to other Block Groups in similarly sized population centers or in tribal areas. If a Block Group’s value for a given demographic measure is at or above the 80 th percentile within its population center size category, it is given 2 points for that factor. If its value is at or above the 60 th percentile within its population center size category, it is given 1 point. All other Block Groups receive 0 points for that factor. Block groups that overlap with or touch multiple population centers that have different sizes are assigned the highest possible point value based on all overlapping population centers. For the health and environmental measures sourced from the EHD map, scores are applied based on the measure’s rank value. Block Groups with a rank of 9 or 10 are given 2 points, and Block Groups with a rank of 7 or 8 are given 1 point. This is applied statewide without any scaling within population center sizes, as is performed for the demographic metrics, to ensure that Block Groups with similar environmental or health burdens across the state are scored evenly. Here is a list of measures (included in attribute table), used to calculate the final score: 1. Population less than 18 years of age; 2. Population age 65 or older; 3. Housing cost-burdened households (spending over 30% of income on housing); 4. Black, Indigenous, People of color; 5. Households with 1 or more persons with a disability; 6. Ability to speak English – less than very well; 7. Household income below 200% of the federal poverty level; 8. Zero to one car households; 9. Unemployment; 10. Transportation expense (%) for moderate income families; 11. Limited access to healthy food; 12. Low birthweight (<2500 grams); 13. High rate of hospitalization, based on the maximum rank value from the following variables; (a) Death from cardiovascular disease, (b) Cancer deaths, (c) Lower life expectancy at birth, (d) Premature death; 14. Environmental exposures; 15. Environmental effects; 16. Diesel pollution burden Finally, 1 additional point is given to Block Groups that fall within or touch a tribal area to give a slight priority to areas serving tribal populations. This score, along with the demographic measures from the ACS as well as the transportation expense, limited access to healthy food, low birthweight, and high rate of hospitalization measures from the EHD Map are summed together to create the total vulnerable population score. The three environmental measures from the EHD Map are summed together to create the total overburdened communities score.

The RRAP report is available here: https://mil.wa.gov/asset/5d8ba2a03a1b7. The state bridge results in GIS format are available here: https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/mapsdata/geodatacatalog/default.htm . Technical and user manuals for the BSST tool are available here: https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1581518-washington-state-highway-bridge-seismic-screening-tool-bsst-technical-report In addition to the state bridges that were analyzed above, local bridges were obtained from WSDOT and analyzed in the BSST which is the data that is presented here. The data was provided from WSDOT to CISA Region 10. Much of the data for local (city/county) bridges were taken from the national bridge inventory and additional data that WSDOT had available. The local data used in the BSST is not complete and should be updated at the local level by bridge engineers and GIS specialist and analyzed in the BSST to ensure the latest bridge information is included in the tool. The data provided here is an initial analysis using data from WSDOT but it is recommend that local jurisdictions update their information and re-run the tool to ensure the most accurate data is used. The data provided here only includes bridges in western/central WA and only for a Cascadia 9.0M event. The 4,306 local highway bridges incorporated into this study from the WSDOT bridge inventory database were assessed using the BSST analysis methodology detailed previously in this report. Results consist of three types of outcomes: Bridge Damage Levels and Types, Bridge Repair Types, and Bridge Reopening Times. All output is a part of this feature class. Bridge damage types are projected on the basis of both damage level (None, Moderate, Significant), whether a bridge is a special bridge type, and also the types of damage that the bridge will experience (including both direct seismic and secondary earthquake-induced impacts); The projected repair types and reopening times necessary to bring bridges back to a minimum level of functionality that enables their use for emergency response were computed using the methodology specified in the Bridge Reopening Times section. Refer to the BSST Technical Report. The BSST was developed to assess the potential impacts of a CSZ earthquake to highway bridges in Washington State at a system-level as part of the Washington State Transportation Systems RRAP project. The results provided identify the Damage Levels, Damage Types, Repair Types and Reopening Times associated with 4,306 bridges located in Western and Central Washington that were evaluated for this RRAP project. Understanding that this analysis likely constitutes a “worst-case scenario” with respect to bridge damage, the results nonetheless project that the majority of bridges in Washington State will experience moderate to significant damage resulting from a CSZ earthquake. While the majority of bridges that experience damage could be reopened within one year of the earthquake, a substantial number of those bridges are projected to take more than a year to reopen—in many cases 2 or more years. The results also project that while many bridges may be reopened after either minor repairs/inspections or the construction of a temporary bypass road, a substantial number of more significantly damaged bridges span bodies of water and will require complete replacement prior to reopening. This suggests that significant gains in roadway corridor reopening times could be gained by focusing on retrofits or upgrades to these more vulnerable bridges that span rivers and other bodies of water. This tool is primarily intended to inform regional highway prioritization for emergency response activities; however, the BSST provides a useful evaluation methodology that could be applied to other regional emergency preparedness and infrastructure assessment studies. This could include studies of bridge infrastructure to other potential seismic events within the region, or at varying jurisdictional levels (i.e., county, local). The BSST also uses currently available seismic, seismically-induced secondary hazard and infrastructure information. As new seismic information becomes available, or as secondary-hazards (e.g., landslides, avalanches) become characterized more comprehensively, such information could be integrated into the current BSST methodology. Similarly, as seismic retrofit activities or other infrastructure improvement projects continue throughout Washington State, or as new infrastructure are built, it will be important that the infrastructure data integrated in the BSST also be updated periodically. Doing so will ensure that planners and infrastructure managers maintain the most current and complete understanding of the network-level seismic risks of a CSZ event to bridges in Washington. Please note that all results from the BSST are based on a model and information received from WSDOT. Damages from an earthquake may be different than what is provided here. Liquefaction data was used within the BSST tool. WADNR is the source for liquefaction data and is available here: https://www.dnr.wa.gov/programs-and-services/geology/geologic-hazards/geologic-hazard-maps#nehrp-site-class-and-liquefaction-susceptibilityUSGS ShakeMap was also used in the BSST tool for a M9.0 Cascadia earthquake and is available here: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/scenarios/eventpage/gllegacycasc9p0expanded_se/shakemap/pga. Data Assumptions/MethodologyData was provided by WSDOT for all local bridges. Data was transferred into BSST format. Bridges that were not included in the Cascadia 9.0M ShakeMap were removed from the tool. This mainly encompasses bridges in the far eastern side of the state. Removed all bridges that were designated as a pedestrian, trail or dam. Removed all bridges that had null or 0 structure length. Those bridges that had no main span quantity, all were changed to 1, meaning a single span bridge. For the bridges missing the federal functional class a value of 9 was assigned. For the bridges with a null in waterway adequacy these values were changed to N. For those bridges that had a null value for scour code these were change to N. Some points had low accuracy coordinates (lat/longs), so these locations were removed from the database since they could not be found. For those bridges that had a BMS elements ID related to a Pier Wall a W code was added to the Pier Type in the road bridges spreadsheet of the BSST tool. This would ensure these bridges were counted as having a pier wall. This information should be updated and verified by local jurisdictions. Snohomish County used the tool for their local bridges. A few of the bridges output in this tool was updated to reflect their results since better data was provided by the county. The tool uses AASHTO curves from various years. These curves were digitized in GIS from a pdf map. The accuracy of these maps could be up to +/- 10 miles due to digitizing the data at the state level. Most of the offset occurred in eastern WA, so impacts should be minimal.","WSDOT,DOT,Washington,State,WA,Department,Transportation,Emergency Management,Bridge,Resiliency,TRN,018,Open,Data,Rdwy Infr,Plnng","The Regional Resiliency Assessment Program (RRAP) is a cooperative assessment of specific critical infrastructure within a designated geographic area and a regional analysis of the surrounding infrastructure that addresses a range of infrastructure resilience issues that could have regionally and nationally significant consequences. In 2017, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) sponsored the Washington State Transportation Systems RRAP project in coordination with the Washington Emergency Management Division (EMD), Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), and other regional stakeholders. This project is focused on assessing the impacts of a Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) earthquake on state transportation systems and, in particular, how those impacts may affect the ability of emergency response efforts to move supplies into the region. The intended outcome of this analysis is the prioritization of transportation routes and modes for additional planning, investment, hardening, or other activities to enhance their resilience—and therefore, to enhance their ability to support response and recovery efforts following a CSZ earthquake. An important part of this transportation system-level assessment has been to assess the seismic vulnerability of the state highway system. In doing so, the RRAP project team developed a Bridge Seismic Screening Tool (BSST) to assess, at a system-level, the potential impacts that a CSZ earthquake could have on state highway bridges. The first step in the BSST is to assess the seismic vulnerability of highway bridge infrastructure in Washington State following a CSZ earthquake to determine a projected or potential damage state. Damage states are then used to determine approximate reopening times for bridge crossings. State bridges were analyzed which is available as a seperate download. This data focuses on local bridges and impacts from a Cascadia 9.0M event.","/Categories/Planning,/Categories/Roadway Infrastructure","Washington State Department of Transportation","For Planning use only.

Often, however, site index, the most commonly used measure of a site's potential productivity, is not available for red alder as other species occupy the site. In order to make site-specific management decisions, the suitability for red alder production can be assessed by geographic and topographic position, soil moisture and aeration during the growing season, and soil fertility and physical condition (Harrington 1986). The difficulty of weighing these physical factors to determine site suitability appears to be a major impediment to the establishment of red alder plantations. Additionally, forest managers are lacking a planning tool that would consider red alder in the landscape for long term management plans. To assist forest managers in their planning and site selection efforts, we developed a GIS-based Red Alder Site Suitability Model based on physical criteria identified by Harrington (1986) as most influential on the productivity of red alder. The major components of the model are elevation, topographic position, slope, aspect, soil type, and soil depth. The model was implemented in a GIS (ESRI ArcPro v.3.0) raster environment with topographic position, slope, aspect, and elevation derived from a 10-meter digital elevation model (DEM), using lidar data where available. Topographic position class of valley, lower slope, flat slope, middle slope, upper slope, or ridgetop was derived from the topographic position index (TPI) using standard deviation thresholds as described by Weiss (2001). The soil texture and depth were derived from Washington DNR’s corporate soil data layer. Each pixel was then classified and assigned one of four suitability categories: High, Medium, Low, and No Potential. Because of the level of spatial detail of the model, forest managers can assess the potential of red alder management on any given site, such as planned timber harvest. Additionally, the model can be used at a larger scale, i.e. planning for future product diversification in a watershed. The model has been cursorily field-verified on existing red alder plantations and compared with locations and site index of natural red alder stands for DNR's forest inventory system. Initial results indicate that the model is accurate in identifying sites with potential for intensive red alder management. Local knowledge will still be an important factor in the application of the model. Frost pockets or areas susceptible to other physical damage such as ice damage (i.e. within the east wind drafts of the Columbia River Gorge) are not identified in by this model. The usefulness of this model will be determined by the experience of the field staff over time. References: Harrington, Constance A. 1986. A method of site quality evaluation for red alder. Gen.

For the ASRP, the entire Chehalis Basin was divided into Geospatial Units (GSUs). These GSUs are relatively small areas primarily defined by being a watershed to either a first-order stream or a stream- or river segment. They are used to define inputs to the Ecosystem Diagnosis and Treatment model (EDT), which is a spatially-aware model primarily used to estimate the impact of interventions on highly mobile aquatic species, such as salmon. The Ecoregions in this dataset were created by combining the smaller GSUs into larger units with similar ecological, geological, and in particular hydrological characteristics. Drainage basins for large and medium river systems, like the Wynoochee, Satsop, Skookumchuck, etc. were preserved intact within single ecoregions. Smaller drainage basins, like the Johns and Humptulips rivers, were combined with other basins to make up larger Ecoregions. Primarily, the Ecoregions were derived to support the EDT salmon model, and the development of restoration scenarios (see 4.2.2.1 of the ASRP Phase 1 document). Questions asked at the Ecoregion level included species distribution, the relative value of different restoration measures, and priority actions for each Ecoregion. The Ecoregions were created by ICF International Inc. in January 2017.

These maps indicate the relative stability of coastal slopes as interpreted by geologists based on aerial photographs, geological mapping, topography, and field observations. Such methods are standard, but may occasionally result in some unstable areas being overlooked and in some stable areas being incorrectly identified as unstable.

This report originated from the agriculture and water quality talks that took place in 2012. Participating agencies agreed that if data exists, everyone should be able to see it in one central location. Agencies that contributed included the Washington Dept. of Ecology, Washington Dept. of Health, Washington Dept. of Agriculture, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Natural Resource Conservation Service, U.S. Geological Survey, and the Washington Conservation Commission. The Safe Drinking Water Act nitrate limit for delivery of water from public water systems is 10 mg/L. This limit has been exceeded in public water supplies and private wells in various areas of the state going back decades. Not only is contaminated groundwater a public health issue, treatment is also very costly to the public water supply systems and individual households who must deal with contamination on their own. The goals of this project were to: Collect and organize statewide information about nitrate monitoring results, the physical factors that tend toward nitrate contamination, and United States Geological Survey (USGS) risk studies that evaluate the physical factors against monitoring results. Delineate areas where high nitrates in groundwater occur. Prioritize those areas by potential impacts to people and resources. Make the information available to everyone. The inputs for developing candidate Nitrate Priority Areas include: A single database of nitrate sampling results for groundwater compiled from state and federal databases. USGS nitrate risk studies. Surficial geology, soil properties, topography, well locations and depths, agricultural land use, irrigated areas, annual average precipitation, nitrate concentrations, and population. Monitoring data from the USGS and the Washington State Departments of Health and Ecology were collected and summarized. The well locations were mapped using a Geographic Information System (GIS). Clusters of wells where a sample has exceeded 10 mg/L are a strong indicator that groundwater at that location is at high risk of, or currently is contaminated by nitrate. Other indicators include USGS nitrate risk analyses, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) soil drainage classes and travel time through the soil profile (Ksat), surficial geology, recharge and well depths. Boundaries for candidate Nitrate Priority Areas were developed based on section lines that approximate natural boundaries. These areas will be subject to review and change where appropriate. Once the proposed Nitrate Priority Areas have been reviewed, section line-based boundaries may be replaced by natural boundaries where appropriate. Time series plots were produced for wells with four or more sample results with at least one result over 5 mg/L. This resulted in a distribution of over 1200 graphs across the state. These are accessible through the GIS as a popup from the well location point for those who have a GIS system with this capability, and who request and receive the necessary files. A web-based application would make these graphs widely and easily available. Challenges with databases always include checking for errors, such as the occasional locational or data entry error. Care must be used to understand the limitations of the data and the peculiarities of each data source. These issues are described more in this report. Recommendations include developing a web application to make this information easily accessible by anyone with internet access, and automating the data downloads so they are easily updated. Management of nitrate sources to prevent groundwater contamination should be adjusted for sensitive conditions like excessively draining soils and very hydrologically conductive geologic materials. Nitrate source loading needs to be reduced in impacted areas to prevent groundwater contamination. Results of this study can be used to protect public drinking water supplies by focusing actions on areas within the state that have the highest potential for impacts due to nitrate contamination of groundwater.","Washington State Department of Ecology,ECY,Water Quality Program,WQ,GEO,geoscientificInformation,008,Health,water,United States Geological Survey,USGS,risk studies,landscape,groundwater,nitrate,NO3","In order to delineate areas where high nitrates in groundwater occur, Ecology used monitoring data, USGS nitrate risk studies, and landscape patterns of contributing factors to nitrate contamination.

It also features information on channel characteristics such as stream flow and physical dimensions. This data layer’s main feature is a classification of channel migration potential based on channel confinement and erosion potential. The layer was derived from existing statewide geospatial datasets and classified according to channel migration measurements by the High Resolution Change Detection (HRCD) project for the Puget Sound Region (Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, 2014). While the layer identifies the potential for channel migration, it does not predict channel migration rates. Thus, this data layer should be used to screen and prioritize stream reaches for further channel migration evaluation. The tool helps plan and prioritize floodplain management actions such as Channel Migration Zone mapping, erosion risk reduction, and floodplain restoration. The background, use, and development of the CHAMP layer are fully described in Ecology Publication 15-06-003 (full report citation and URL below).

Legal Description areas are referred to in written legal descriptions used in the conveyance of parcels.  In the Public Land Survey states, of which most non-colonial states including Washington are counted, the most widely recognized legal description area is called a Section.  Normally there are 36 Sections in a Township, which is another legal description area.  In Washington (and in Oregon) many early land claims took the form of Donation Land Claims, which are, like Sections, confined to being a part of a Township.  Tracts, which are used by federal surveys to denote irregular areas where the claim to ownership is based on bona fide rights, and Protracted Blocks, which are a buffer between surveyed areas and areas of unsurveyed (protracted) Sections, are two additional subdivisions of Townships.  Sections were not normally subdivided, except in theory, by the federal surveys.  The subdivisions of Sections performed by county and local surveyors, using the federal design or schema for section subdivisions, are also part of the Legal Description layer.  The fabric of Townships, Sections and their subdivisions, Donation Land Claims, Tracts and Protracted Blocks comprise what is known as the Public Land Survey System (PLSS).  These PLSS surveys are referred to as Rectangular Surveys, due to their characteristic orientation to true meridian and to the normally square-like character of the areas encompassed.  Other irregular federal surveys are included in the Legal Description layer.  These include Mineral Surveys, Homestead Entry Surveys, Townsites and non-rectangular Indian Allotments.  Under the authority of Counties and Cities many local subdivisions of the PLSS have been created and are included in the Legal Description Layer.  Local subdivisions include the streets, blocks and lots that are common in urban and suburban environments.

Three types of Parcels are currently held in the parcel layer.  The number of Parcel types may increase in the future.  Ownership Parcels, parcel type code 1, consist of Washington State owned land managed by the Department of Natural Resources.  Most ownership parcels are held and managed for the benefit of some trust such as the Common School and Indemnity trust.  Of the several parcel types, only Ownership Parcels represent the entire extent of the particular type of land managed by DNR.  The other parcel types are incomplete data sets.  Disposed Parcels, parcel type code 2, consist of ownership parcels that have been disposed of since July 1, 2007.  A very few parcels disposed of prior to that date are also included.  Easement Parcels, parcel type code 3, consist of various types of easements acquired for the State by the Department.  Some of the Easements are negative easements over land not owned by the State, for example Conservation Easements which remove certain development rights away for the parcel owner.

compiled by the Washington Military Department on August 22, 2019. The All
Hazards Alert Broadcasting System (AHAB) data points supply visual depiction of
where the siren locations are along the Washington State Coast and some inland
waterways. If an actual tsunami event occurs the sirens supply not only audible
but visual warnings of the impending danger via a wailing audio sound and an
intense blue light for the hearing impaired, which can also cut through fog and
is visible from a long distance. The sirens further supply a 4500-watt public
address system to relay verbal information to the local populations or play
digitally pre-recorded messages. The siren design enables a 360-degree
coverage. Has the capability to make test and actual evacuation announcements
in English and Spanish (These are pre-recorded on each siren’s installed micro
SD card.) Using pre-programmed phrases and words, messages can be created at
any control point for such things as ‘Shelter in Place’, and Hazardous Material
Notification. Siren positional data is derived from the satellite transponder attached
to each siren which derives its location from current GPS satellites deployed
by the United States.

AAAs are located throughout the United States and are available in every county within Washington State. AAA's help older adults plan and find additional care, services, or programs. Help can range from getting services for a frail adult so he or she can remain at home to providing access to activities and socialization through programs like senior centers. They also provide support and services to the family or friends helping to care for older adults. Tribal AAA Planning Service Area boundaries are defined using United States Census Bureau's updated 2017 American Indian Area boundaries.

ZIP Codes refer to mail delivery routes and not to areas such as those bounded by the TomTom derived data. Therefore, addresses (and other features) are not truly ""in"" ZIP Codes. Rather, ZIP Codes refer to mail delivery routes along which mail boxes have been placed to receive mail. Also, the USPS can and does change ZIP Code identifiers and the mail delivery routes that they identify. USPS changes result in boundary changes in the TomTom ZIP Code Postal District derived data at each quarterly release.

In cooperation with the Washington State Department of Ecology, DNR Forest Practices developed a systematic reclassification of the original USFWS wetlands codes into WAC 222-16-035 types. The reclassification was done in 1995 according to the Forest Practice Rules in place at the time. The WAC's for defining wetlands are 222-16-035 and 222-16-050. It is intended that these data be only a first step in determining whether or not wetland issues have been or need to be addressed in an area. The DNR Forest Practices Division and the Department of Ecology strongly supports the additional use of hydric soils (from the GIS soils layer) to add weight to the call of  'wetland'. Reports from the Department of Ecology indicate that these data may substantially underestimate the extent of forested wetlands.  Various studies show the NWI data is 25-80% accurate in forested areas.  Most of these data were collected from stereopaired aerial photos at a scale of 1:58,000.  The stated accuracy is that of a 1:24,000 map, or plus or minus 40 feet. In addition, some parts of the state have data that are 30 years old and only a small percentage have been field checked. Thus, for regulatory purposes, the user should not rely solely on these data. On-the-ground checking must accompany any regulatory call based on these data. The reclassification is based on the USFWS FWS_CODE. The FWS_CODE is a concatenation of three subcomponents:  Wetland system, class, and water regime. Forest Practices further divided the components into system, subsystem, class, subclass, water regime, special modifiers, xclass, subxclass, and xsystem.  The last three items (xsomething) are for wetland areas which do not easily lend themselves to one class alone. The resulting classification system uses two fields: WLND_CLASS and WLND_TYPE. WLND_CLASS indicates whether the polygon is a forested wetland (F), open water (O), or a vegetated wetland (W). WLND_TYPE, indicates whether the wetland is a type A (1), type B (2), or a generic wetland (3) that doesn't fit the categories for A or B type wetlands. WLND_TYPE = 0 (zero) is used where WLND_CLASS = O (letter ""O""). 

The wetland polygon is classified as F, forested wetland; O, open water; or W, vegetated wetland depending on the following FWS_CODE categories: F                        O                      W

The data set was designed as a polygon coverage, delineated on 1:250,000- scale map overlays and digitized in 1991. It was plotted and proofed, but not completed at that time. Beginning in August, 1994 the coverage STRMTEMP was edited, corrected, and proofed. The data set is now a polygon feature class and shows only Class AA, A, and B polygons. It does not address Lake Class completely (some lakes are delineated, some not); see notes below for explanation. Specific conditions of certain stream segments are also not addressed by the feature class. The WAC MUST be referred to whenever this data set is used. The 1991 MPL coverage was used in delineating the extent of AA polygons. Changes through time in Federal land boundaries may affect the classification of waters in those lands. SUMMARY OF TEMPERATURE CLASSIFICATIONS DESIGNATED IN CHAPTER 173-201A WAC WATERQUALITY STANDARDS FOR SURFACE WATERS OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON WAC 173-201A-030 General water use and criteria classes (1) Class AA (extraordinary) Temperature shall not exceed 16.0 degrees C (freshwater) or 13.0 degrees C (marine water) due to human activities. (2) Class A (excellent) Temperature shall not exceed 18.0 degrees C (freshwater) or 16.0 degrees C (marine water) due to human activities. (3) Class B (good) Temperature shall not exceed 21.0 degrees C (freshwater) or 19.0 degrees C (marine water) due to human activities. (4) Class C (fair) Temperature shall not exceed 22.0 degrees C due to human activities. For all of the above classes, when natural conditions exceed the listed temperature, no temperature increases will be allowed which will raise the receiving water temperature by greater than 0.3 degrees C. (5) Lake Class Temperature - no measurable change from natural conditions. *** Notes regarding WAC 173-201A sections 130 and 140 - Specific classifications for fresh and marine waters: All lakes and their feeder streams are classified as Lake Class. In this data set some large lakes and their feeder streams have had polygons created around them. These are shown as Class AA. Many lakes too small to be separately delineated may be contained within Class B, A, or AA polygons. Some stream segments have special conditions applied to their temperature standards. These conditions are listed in the WAC but are not delineated in the polygon coverage. These include the Columbia River, Duwamish River, Grande Ronde River, Hoquiam River, Lake Washington Ship Canal, Mill Creek (near Walla Walla), Palouse River, Pend Oreille River, Puyallup River, Skagit River, Snake River, Spokane River, Walla Walla River, Wishkah River, Yakima River, and Tacoma city waterway in Commencement Bay. These Special temperature designations are for the stream waters in the listed segment only. Temperature standards for all waters feeding that segment are as shown in the polygon coverage. This data set is a polygon coverage, and does not contain information on all surface waters listed in the WAC. All questions pertaining to temperature classification of surface waters in Washington must be clarified by referring to the WAC.","stream temperature,DNR,Washington,hydrography,Washington Department of Natural Resources,Forest Practices","Stream Temperature Class for Forest Practices Regulation for Washington State","","Washington Department of Natural Resources, Forest Practices Division; the Department of Ecology and the Olympic National Forest.","The Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR) provides these geographic data as is.

WADNR SOILS LAYER INFORMATION LAYER: SOILS GEN.SOURCE: State soils mapping program CODE DOCUMENT: State soil surveys CONTACT: NA COVER TYPE: Spatial polygon coverage DATA TYPE: Primary data Information for the SOILS data layer was derived from the Private Forest Land Grading system (PFLG) and subsequent soil surveys.  PFLG was a five year mapping program completed in 1980 for the purpose of forest land taxation. It was funded by the Washington State Department of Revenue in cooperation with the Department of Natural Resources, Soil Conservation Service (SCS), USDA Forest Service and Washington State University. State and private lands which had the potential of supporting commercial forest stands were surveyed.  Some Indian tribal and federal lands were surveyed.  Because this was a cooperative soil survey project, agricultural and non- commercial forest lands were also included within some survey areas. After the Department of Natural Resources originally developed its geographic information system, digitized soils delineations and a few soil attributes were transferred to the system.  Remaining PFLG soil attributes were added at a later time and are now available through associated lookup tables.  SCS soils data on agricultural lands also have subsequently been added to this data layer. Approximately 1100 townships wholly or partially contain digitized soils data (2101 townships would provide complete coverage of the state of Washington). SOILS data are currently stored in the Polygon Attribute Table (.PAT) and INFO expansion files.

Access is available to all residents with specific emphasis on remote learning for students. Additionally, this service can be used for job searches, telehealth, telework, unemployment filing, and census participation.

The locations listed on this map represent new Drive-In WiFi Hotspot sites located at Washington State University Extension locations, as well as new and existing Washington State Library Drive-In WiFi Hotspots. 

Launching primarily as parking lot hotspots in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the free community Wi-Fi is accessible regardless of how users arrive at the locations. Some sites also offer indoor public access during business hours. Everyone using the sites – outside or inside – must practice social distancing and hygiene precautions, including staying in your vehicle or at least six feet from other users and wearing a mask if necessary.

Each hotspot will have its own security protocol. Some will be open and others will have Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) safe security installed.

Broadband equity is not just a rural challenge. The drive-In Wi-Fi hotspot project addresses underserved and economically disadvantaged communities in urban and suburban areas as well.

widespread animal mortality, rapid response and disposal are critical. Washington
State Dept. of Agriculture (WSDA) has developed this geodatabase to help identify
some of the possible carcass disposal options that may be available during
animal mortality events.

In the event of a Foreign Animal Disease (FAD) outbreak, the
USDA FAD PReP/NAHEMS Guidelines: Disposal document provides guidance on
choosing and using the best disposal methods for a range of situations.

The data displayed on this map includes landfills, rendering
plants, pet crematoriums, and incinerators (each symbolized by a different
color), along with attributes of each (viewed by clicking on each
point).  There are three additional layers identifying boundaries of
Washington conservation districts, local health jurisdictions and solid waste
collection company boundaries. Transportation and disposal of animal carcasses
in Washington State must comply with federal,
state, and
local requirements, including local
health department regulations.

WSDA does not regulate the facilities included in this map and
the data does not represent all potential disposal options in the state. During
emergency situations and natural disasters, other disposal options might be
identified on a case-by-case basis. Consult with Washington State departments
of Agriculture
and Ecology
to help determine the best methods for carcass disposal options during these
scenarios.","WA,WSDA,Disposal sites,Agriculture,Animal","Disposal sources for animal mortality events in WA.","/Categories/Public maps and resources","","","en-us","https://nras.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=a1350eb564f24926b4af1c9dc93cfdc3","public",,"EMRG_MGMT","",""

This dataset is intended for use at 1:24,000 scale. WAU's are used by the Timber/Fish/Wildlife cooperators as the boundaries for watershed analysis studies and other natural resources management purposes on state and privately owned lands.    WAU represents the administrative boundaries of 846 units. The boundaries are mainly along drainage divides (ridges), with some along rivers and other Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR) management boundaries. In the forested areas of the state WAUs range in size from 3,822 to 297,614 acres with a mean of 40,187 acres and a standard deviation of 26,697 acres. On the Columbia Plateau WAU areas range in size from 35,098 to 1,765,555 acres.  This version of the WAU boundaries is current as of April 2006.   Administrative boundaries based on hydrology form a general hierarchy. Water Resource Inventory Areas (WRIAs) are the largest unit, BASINs are subunits of WRIAs, and WAUs are subunits of BASINs. However, boundaries in this hierarchy do not necessarliy match in all areas.  Where watershed analysis was been conducted, WAU boundaries may cross WRIA lines.  Do not use WAU to derive WRIA boundaries. WRIA is managed and maintained by the Washington Department of Ecology.","DNR,WAU,watershed,watershed analysis,watershed administrative unit,hydrography,Forest Practices,Washington Department of Natural Resources","Watershed Administrative Units","","Washington State Department of Natural Resources Forest Practices Division

database, but funding to complete that statewide project was not made available
at the time.

In 2009, the Federal Government outlined the need for trails
database schema in their Data Standards Review Committee, stressing the
efficiency in management decisions that a streamlined database can provide.

“The collection, storage and management of trail related
data are important components of everyday business activities in many federal
and state land-managing agencies, trail organizations and businesses. From a
management perspective, trails data must often mesh closely with other types of
infrastructure, resource and facility enterprise data.”

In 2014, the Washington State Office of the Chief Information
Officer's (OCIO) Geospatial Program Office acquired a Nonhighway and Off-Road Vehicle
Activities (NOVA) Program grant through the Washington State Recreation and
Conservation Office (RCO) giving the OCIO initial funding to develop a
statewide trails database based on Federal Geographic Data Committee standards.
Using the same standard for all trails data will allow land managers and
recreational users throughout the state to access and use the data regardless
of administrative boundary.

""Data standards will make it easier for trail
information to be accessed and exchanged and used by more than one individual
agency or group…Ease in sharing data increases the capability for enhanced and
consistent mapping, inventory, monitoring, conditions assessment, maintenance,
costing, budgeting, information retrieval, and summary reporting for internal
and external needs.”

Along with streamlining data and facilitating efficiency in
management practices across agencies, the database will provide a source of
trails information that is open and free to the public.

The 2016 State Legislature provided additional funding from the
Nonhighway and Off-road Vehicle Activities Account to the Office of the Chief
Information Officer to continue work on the database.

Additional details about the project can be found here:

PHS is a source of best available science that can inform local planning activities, development projects, conservation strategies, incentive programs, and numerous other land use applications. The species and habitats that appear on the map are informed by WDFWs PHS List. The map displays known locations of priority habitats and species that have been provided to the department by agency biologists and other sources of scientific data about species and habitat locations. Data is updated as new information is gathered and verified in the field. This map should not be considered an exhaustive survey of all fish and wildlife presence. The data displayed on PHS on the Web is for informational purposes only. Before making final decisions about a project or plan using this map, WDFW strongly recommends a field visit by a fish and wildlife biologist or habitat expert to make determinations about species presence, absence, or exact location. The location of species can change over time, not every parcel has been surveyed and biologists add new field observations on a regular basis. Please note: The specific location of some fish and wildlife information is not available on PHS on the Web. These locations deemed “sensitive” by WDFW are not displayed on the map beyond a certain resolution (e.g. Township or Section) due to an increased risk of human interference.

spawning habitat for Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) and Surf smelt

habitat of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), in western Washington's marine
waters. Also displayed are Pacific herring pre-spawner holding areas. Forage
fish survey beaches are also displayed. Sand lance, surf smelt and Pacific
herring are collectively referred to as forage fish. They are important prey for
many species of mammals, birds and fish, including salmon. Sand lance and surf
smelt spawn in the upper intertidal zone of beaches comprised of mixed sand and
gravel. These fine-grained spawning substrates are susceptible to nearshore
development where substrate coarsening may reduce available habitat. Herring
deposit their eggs on marine vegetation: eelgrass and various algae, in the
shallow subtidal and intertidal zone generally at tidal elevations from +3 feet
to -20 feet Mean Low Low Waterline (MLLW). The accurate representation of
forage fish spawning habitat and delivery of those data to public sources is
necessary for the conservation of these species.

Starting in 1812 land was divided into square six mile blocks called townships, then subdivided into sections and ranges. Each subdivided area was surveyed and given its own map or GLO. During this process surveyors were required to indicate cultural resources such as roads and Indian trails and standardized symbols were used to represent geographic features. These GLOs are now maintained by the Bureau of Land Management as part of the official Land Status and Cadastral Survey records. As land was divided into parcels of individual ownership additional cadastral survey maps were created over time. For this reason there are often multiple GLOs or ""cadastral survey maps"" for one township / range, generally numbered one through four. For this seamless GLO layer, DAHP focused solely on the more historical GLOs which were usually listed as image number one or two for that specific township / range in the BLM Cadastral Survey records. In some cases no GLOs were available for review. Such areas included National Forest Lands, National Parks, Indian Reservations, and remote wilderness areas.","Government Land Office Maps,Washington","This dataset was hand digitized from the General Land Office Plat maps dating back to the early 1800s.

It is part of a nationwide effort by all 50 states and five U.S. territories to develop conservation action plans and participate in the State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (SWG) Program. These data layers represent both the observed species range, as well as, the modeled potential species range for Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN), as identified in Washington’s State Wildlife Action Plan, 2015.  Species range is defined as the geographic area, in which a species regularly occurs within Washington, including areas used for breeding as well as important distinct foraging, wintering, or migration areas, where appropriate. Range does not include accidental, infrequent, or peripheral areas that are disconnected from the regularly occurring area or wintering or migration areas that are generally broad and nonspecific. SWAP SGCN species ranges (observed and potential) are spatially represented, using USGS watershed boundaries (USGS hydrologic units - HUCS) at various scales. Potential suitable habitat distribution data for each of the SCGN species was derived from “Ecological Systems” data.   Ecological Systems were developed by NatureServe to provide a mid-scale ecological classification, for uplands and wetlands, useful for conservation and environmental planning. The Washington State SWAP data is organized as a collection of individual species ranges (observed and potential range polygons), as well as, potential habitat distribution raster files - that have been compressed (into a ZIP files) for download.

In 2009, the Federal Government outlined the need for trails database schema in their Data Standards Review Committee, stressing the efficiency in management decisions that a streamlined database can provide. “The collection, storage and management of trail related data are important components of everyday business activities in many federal and state land-managing agencies, trail organizations and businesses. From a management perspective, trails data must often mesh closely with other types of infrastructure, resource and facility enterprise data.” In 2014, the Washington State Office of the Chief Information Officer's (OCIO) Geospatial Program Office acquired a Nonhighway and Off-Road Vehicle Activities (NOVA) Program grant through the Washington State Recreation and Conservation Office (RCO) giving the OCIO initial funding to develop a statewide trails database based on Federal Geographic Data Committee standards. Using the same standard for all trails data will allow land managers and recreational users throughout the state to access and use the data regardless of administrative boundary. ""Data standards will make it easier for trail information to be accessed and exchanged and used by more than one individual agency or group…Ease in sharing data increases the capability for enhanced and consistent mapping, inventory, monitoring, conditions assessment, maintenance, costing, budgeting, information retrieval, and summary reporting for internal and external needs.” Along with streamlining data and facilitating efficiency in management practices across agencies, the database will provide a source of trails information that is open and free to the public.

It is part of a nationwide effort by all 50 states and five U.S. territories to develop conservation action plans and participate in the State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (SWG) Program. These data layers represent both the observed species range, as well as, the modeled potential species range for Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN), as identified in Washington’s State Wildlife Action Plan, 2015.  Species range is defined as the geographic area, in which a species regularly occurs within Washington, including areas used for breeding as well as important distinct foraging, wintering, or migration areas, where appropriate. Range does not include accidental, infrequent, or peripheral areas that are disconnected from the regularly occurring area or wintering or migration areas that are generally broad and nonspecific. SWAP SGCN species ranges (observed and potential) are spatially represented, using USGS watershed boundaries (USGS hydrologic units - HUCS) at various scales. Potential suitable habitat distribution data for each of the SCGN species was derived from “Ecological Systems” data.   Ecological Systems were developed by NatureServe to provide a mid-scale ecological classification, for uplands and wetlands, useful for conservation and environmental planning. The Washington State SWAP data is organized as a collection of individual species ranges (observed and potential range polygons), as well as, potential habitat distribution raster files - that have been compressed (into a ZIP files) for download.

Bathymetry data can be stored in a number of formats including point soundings, isobaths (contours), and grids. The bathymetry mosaic dataset is a grid coverage of water depth generated from point soundings. The grid structure is a regular array of cells referenced to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system. Each grid cell represents water depth for a discrete 20- x 20-meter area. The mosaic is a continuous grid covering Washington marine waters, Oregon waters as far south as Seaside, and the Columbia River upstream to Bonneville Dam. Canadian marine waters are included for southern Vancouver Island. The dataset was funded by the Puget Sound Ambient Monitoring Program (PSAMP). Primary bathymetry grid processing was performed under contract by Environmental Consultants (ECI), Portland, Oregon.","bathymetry,soundings,marine water depth,Washington,Oregon,British Columbia,Puget Sound,Pacific Ocean,Strait of Juan de Fuca,Columbia River","The bathymetry mosaic is best applied in medium scale applications (e.g., 1:100,000-scale). In regions of high depth sounding density, such as in some regions of Puget Sound, larger scale applications may be possible. The bathymetry mosaic can be readily combined with other spatial data in a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for scientific study, environmental management, isobath generation, and cartographic display.","","Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, Olympia, Washington.","1. The bathymetry dataset not to be used for navigational purposes. 2. Shoreline detail has been generalized due to grid cell processing. For projects needing fine-scale shoreline detail, it may be necessary to use point soundings and a vector shoreline, as well as additional low/high tide information, for generation of a bathymetry surface. 3. The grid cell depth values in intertidal areas in the bathymetry mosaic may be misleading. The input point soundings are referenced to Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW), and the shoreline represents the high waterline. Thus, sounding interpolation extends from MLLW to the high water line. For larger scale applications the data user may prefer to reconcile low and high tide depths with ancillary intertidal information. 4. Creation of the wide-area mosaic requires a uniform grid cell size. As such, there is a tradeoff between maintaining shoreline detail and interpolation of irregularly spaced soundings. The 20-meter cell size is overly optimistic for some areas given the highly variable depth sounding density observed in the project area. This is especially true for the heavily interpolated offshore region west of a line defined by the coordinates: (46.0, -125) (47.5,-125) (47.5,-125.5) (48.0,-125.5) (48.0,-126)(49,-126).

The computer generated watershed boundary was then manually edited via visual interpretation using topo maps, the DEM files and other watershed boundary maps (notably from the Sea Doc Society). The majority of the editing was in smoothing the original watershed boundary as the auto generated basin was far too detailed for the scale of the map. The smoothing process also removed the ‘raster’ artifacts. For the Salish Sea map the intent was just to show the general boundary as a smooth line that visually follows the topography. Again, the emphasis was for an easy to understand cartographic representation of the basin at a fairly coarse scale, not for exact hydrologic analysis. Purpose For the purposes of this map & dataset, the Salish Sea was defined as including: Puget Sound, Desolation Sound (note, some BC definitions exclude Desolation Sound), Strait of Juan de Fuca (to the mouth of the Pacific Ocean), Strait of Georgia (which I defined as extending to Johnstone Strait).  The Salish Sea polygon and corresponding Basin boundary files were derived for use at approximately 1:1,500,000 (e.g., Salish Sea Map, 2009, http://staff.wwu.edu/stefan/SalishSea.htm).

From a management perspective, trails data must often mesh closely with other types of infrastructure, resource and facility enterprise data.” In 2014, the Washington State Office of the Chief Information Officer's (OCIO) Geospatial Program Office acquired a Nonhighway and Off-Road Vehicle Activities (NOVA) Program grant through the Washington State Recreation and Conservation Office (RCO) giving the OCIO initial funding to develop a statewide trails database based on Federal Geographic Data Committee standards. Using the same standard for all trails data will allow land managers and recreational users throughout the state to access and use the data regardless of administrative boundary. ""Data standards will make it easier for trail information to be accessed and exchanged and used by more than one individual agency or group…Ease in sharing data increases the capability for enhanced and consistent mapping, inventory, monitoring, conditions assessment, maintenance, costing, budgeting, information retrieval, and summary reporting for internal and external needs.”Along with streamlining data and facilitating efficiency in management practices across agencies, the database will provide a source of trails information that is open and free to the public.
