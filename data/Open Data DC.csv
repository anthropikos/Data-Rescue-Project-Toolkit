Through an inclusive and robust public process, the District’s diverse communities will be invited to imagine the kind of city they want for themselves, their neighbors, and their children. Our approach for DC 2050: Community-centered Engagement will reach residents who face the greatest barriers to involvement. Policies will be developed and assessed based on their impact on these populations. Data-driven OP will use data in new ways to help residents learn how the Comprehensive Plan's policies are likely to impact their communities. User-friendly A shorter, visually-appealing, and well-organized document will set priorities that can be easily understood by residents, property owners, investors, and community-based organizations.

A stop may involve a ticket (actual or warning), investigatory stop, protective pat down, search, or arrest. If the final outcome of a stop results in an actual or warning ticket, the ticket serves as the official documentation for the stop. The information provided in the ticket include the subject’s name, race, gender, reason for the stop, and duration. All stops resulting in additional law enforcement actions (e.g., pat down, search, or arrest) are documented in MPD’s Record Management System (RMS). This dataset includes records pulled from both the ticket (District of Columbia Department of Motor Vehicles [DMV]) and RMS sources. Data variables not applicable to a particular stop are indicated as “NULL.” For example, if the stop type (“stop_type” field) is a “ticket stop,” then the fields: “stop_reason_nonticket” and “stop_reason_harbor” will be “NULL.” Each row in the data represents an individual stop of a single person, and that row reveals any and all recorded outcomes of that stop (including information about any actual or warning tickets issued, searches conducted, arrests made, etc.). A single traffic stop may generate multiple tickets, including actual, warning, and/or voided tickets. Additionally, an individual who is stopped and receives a traffic ticket may also be stopped for investigatory purposes, patted down, searched, and/or arrested. If any of these situations occur, the “stop_type” field would be labeled “Ticket and Non-Ticket Stop.” If an individual is searched, MPD differentiates between person and property searches. Please note that the term property in this context refers to a person’s belongings and not a physical building. The “stop_location_block” field represents the block-level location of the stop and/or a street name. The age of the person being stopped is calculated based on the time between the person’s date of birth and the date of the stop. There are certain locations that have a high prevalence of non-ticket stops. These can be attributed to some centralized processing locations. Additionally, there is a time lag for data on some ticket stops as roughly 20 percent of tickets are handwritten. In these instances, the handwritten traffic tickets are delivered by MPD to the DMV, and then entered into data systems by DMV contractors. On August 1, 2021, MPD transitioned to a new version of its current records management system, Mark43 RMS. Beginning January 1, 2023, fields pertaining to the bureau, division, unit, and PSA (if applicable) of the officers involved in events where a stop was conducted were added to the dataset. MPD’s Records Management System (RMS) captures all members associated with the event but cannot isolate which officer (if multiple) conducted the stop itself. Assignments are captured by cross-referencing officers’ CAD ID with MPD’s Timesheet Manager Application. These fields reflect the assignment of the officer issuing the Notice of Infraction (NOIs) and/or the responding officer(s), assisting officer(s), and/or arresting officer(s) (if an investigative stop) as of the end of the two-week pay period for January 1 – June 30, 2023 and as of the date of the stop for July 1, 2023 and forward. The values are comma-separated if multiple officers were listed in the report. For Stop Type = Harbor and Stop Type = Ticket Only, the officer assignment information will be in the NOI_Officer fields. For Stop Type = Ticket and Non-Ticket the officer assignments will be in both NOI Officer (for the officer that issued the NOI) and RMS_Officer fields (for any other officer involved in the event, which may also be the officer who issued the NOI). For Stop Type = Non-Ticket, the officer assignment information will be in the RMS_Officer fields. Null values in officer assignment fields reflect either Reserve Corps members, who’s assignments are not captured in the Timesheet Manager Application, or members who separated from MPD between the time of the stop and the time of the data extraction. Finally, MPD is conducting on-going data audits on all data for thorough and complete information. Figures are subject to change due to delayed reporting, on-going data quality audits, and data improvement processes.","arrest,crime,dc,dc gis,district of columbia,force,mpd,officer contact,police,public safety,safety,stop incidents,Stop incident data,washington dc","In July 2019, the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) implemented new data collection methods that enabled officers to collect more comprehensive information about each police stop in an aggregated manner.

Some impulses initially dismissed as non-gunfire are manually audited and resubmitted to the dataset after ground truth analysis. MPD began implementing the ShotSpotter system in 2006 and has added sensors and upgraded components of the system at various times. ShotSpotter has also enhanced their ability to distinguish gunshots from other impulse noises. For example, the number of impulse noises coded as gunshots during Independence Day celebrations have significantly decreased over the past four years. ShotSpotter does not provide coverage for the entire District of Columbia. Official coverage areas are designed by ShotSpotter in conjunction with MPD, to target high population density areas with frequent sounds of gunshots incidents. A ShotSpotter incident may involve one gunshot or multiple gunshots depending on the time elapsed between each shot. Each incident is given a serial number ID when it occurs.

The Dashboard is a comprehensive, multi-page, online platform providing timely, relevant, and accessible data on 42 racial equity indicators across 7 dimensions of life in the District. This tool will allow the public and District government staff to learn more about racial equity in the District and track our progress towards eliminating racial and ethnic equity gaps and improving outcomes for all District residents.

First and foremost, the incident must be a crime. Although that may seem obvious, most speech is not a hate crime, regardless of how offensive it may be. In addition, a hate crime is not a crime, but a possible motive for a crime. It can be difficult to establish a motive for a crime. Therefore, the classification as a hate crime is subject to change as an investigation proceeds – even as prosecutors continue an investigation. If a person is found guilty of a hate crime, the court may fine the offender up to 1½ times the maximum fine and imprison him or her for up to 1½ times the maximum term authorized for the underlying crime. While the District strives to reduce crime for all residents of and visitors to the city, hate crimes can make a particular community feel vulnerable and more fearful. This is unacceptable, and is the reason everyone must work together not just to address allegations of hate crimes, but also to proactively educate the public about hate crimes. The figures in this data align with DC Official Code 22-3700. Because the DC statute differs from the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) and National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) definitions, these figures may be higher than those reported to the FBI. Each month, an MPD team reviews crimes that have been identified as potentially motivated by hate/bias to determine whether there is sufficient information to support that designation. The data in this document is current through the end of the most recent month. The hate crimes dataset is not an official MPD database of record and may not match details in records pulled from the official Records Management System (RMS). Unknown or blank values in the Targeted Group field may be present prior to 2016 data. As of January 2022, an offense with multiple bias categories would be reflected as such.

The lot numbers normally range from 2000-6999. These condo lots are not geographically defined other than being within a air rights, record, tax or a combination of lots that has one or more condo buildings within it. A condo regime number is assigned to each residential Condo application or Article of Confederation regardless of how many buildings there are at any one site. The Regime number starts with a 1, 2, or 3 depending upon where the condo is located and where they fall in the tri-annual assessment process of RPTA. All numbers after the first are consecutive. RPTA maintains the master list of Regime numbers for residential properties. Commercial condos are not associated with a Regime number and in order to properly track all condos, a unique Regime number was created. RPTA then establishes individual accounts for each condominium unit and assigns a condo lot number to that account. RPTA maintains the master list of Regime numbers and their relationship to approved condos. There are roughly 66571 condo lots and there associations are as follows: 49486 condos were approved for record lots, 16867 were approved for tax lots, 2817 were approved for air rights lots, and 2600 were approved for both air rights and tax lots. The CondoPly layer was created to assist users in visualizing the relationship between ground surface lots (Record Lots), overlay lots (Air Rights & Tax Lots), and the associated Condos. When Condos are approved for ground lots, those lots remain in the production (active) layer and attributes updated to reflect the new condos. When Condos are approved for overlay lots, those lots are killed (dead lots) and archived to their respective history layer.

There are roughly 4896 active squares.  A Square is similar to a city block. Squares were numbered starting at 1 and are currently in the 6000 series. Not all squares are active. A common cause of squares becoming inactive has been through street closing and combining squares. When the squares are combined usually the lower square number is killed and the higher square number is used for the combined square.  For example if squares 1 and 2 are combined, square 1 is killed and the combination becomes square 2. Spatial locations: Each Square is an Island, alone unto itself.  There is not now, and has never been, any citywide Survey Coordinate System in D.C.  Most squares are unrelated to other Squares by “Measured.” They are related by Record.  Street width is approximate. You cannot rely on the published official street widths to set up property lines or determine right-of-way. There is digital scan information available from DDOT regarding Right-of-Way.  Some Squares are divided by streets. That is, the same Square continues on the other side of the street.  Since there is no citywide Survey Coordinate System, squares were placed in their approximate location.  This process is known as “best fit”.","Cadastral,DC,District of Columbia,Land,Lot,Property,Square,Washington DC,vpmdata,squares","This data is used for the planning and management of Washington, D.C. by local government agencies.","/Categories/Property and Land/Vector Property Mapping","Department of Buildings","This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License .","english (united states)","https://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Property_and_Land_WebMercator/FeatureServer/41","public","CC-BY-4.0","Department of Buildings","-77.114193,38.810329,-76.909546,38.995977",""

These lots are strictly for real estate taxation purposes and normally defined under two circumstances: When property owners ask for their real property tax bills to be consolidated, after they have bought several contiguous record lots; this is called a combine; When part of a record lot is sold, but no new record lot is yet defined; this is called a split request. Tax lots are not determined by survey, and are therefore not official lots in the same way record lots are.  These lots are normally numbered between 800 and 1999within a square to differentiate them from record lots on the property tax maps.  When a tax lot is established by RPTA, an A&T Plat is generated by RPTA and forwarded to the surveyor’s office. These A&T Plats are not reviewed but simply filed by the Surveyor; they do not comply with the standards required of subdivision plats, and are not recorded.  Tax Lots are not normally acceptable when applying for building permits and must be converted to Record Lots through the normal subdivision process involving the D.C.

Furthermore, at the time of their creation and platting, there is no review made of tax lots for compliance with D.C. Zoning, Subdivisions or any other ordinances.

Up until approximately 1972, A&T lots were only created by the Tax Assessor out of lands that had been previously Record Lots at some point in their history.

They are official, platted, recorded subdivision lots created by the D.C Surveyor’s Office in compliance with the Subdivision Ordinance of the District of Columbia (must have public street frontage etc). Typically, these lots are numbered 1 through 799 with no number being used more than once in a Square.  Exceptions to this rule: When the 1-799 range has been exhausted within a square, the Surveyor’s Office assigns numbers from 1200 or may even use 8000 and above For reasons unknown, 42 Squares have record lot numbers greater than 799 but less than 1200 Additionally, in most case scenario’s, a piece of property must be a Record Lot before a building permit will be issued for that site in the District of Columbia, and all proposed Record Lots are carefully reviewed by Zoning Administration officials for compliance with the city’s Zoning Ordinances.  Other agencies that review new record lots besides OS are Office of Zoning, Office of Planning, the Dept. of Public Works, Historic Preservation and DDOT. Record lots are defined only when requested by property owners, normally when they are seeking a building permit.  Record lots are recorded in Plat Books and Subdivision Books in the Office of the Surveyor. These documents are bound volumes of historical representations of the locations of property lines, and they include record dimensions, though typically no bearings of lines.  These lots are located within squares, which usually correspond to one or two city blocks. Certain record lots can also be classified as “of-lots”.  An ""Of-Lot"" is the D.C. Surveyor’s Office term for describing “Remaining/Part of Original Lot X” In the record lot feature class, if a domain value of 1 resides in the “OF_LOT” field, you can assume that at one time the original lot was modified. Typically, any of these of-lots will also have a tax lot overlaying them since it is a piece or remainder of a Record Lot.","DC,District of Columbia,Land,Lot,planning cadastre,Property,Square,vpmdata,Washington DC,DOB,record","This data is used for the planning and management of Washington, D.C. by local government agencies.","/Categories/Property and Land/Recorded Lots and Taxation","Department of Buildings","This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License .","english (united states)","https://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/DCGIS/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Property_and_Land_WebMercator/FeatureServer/19","public","CC-BY-4.0","City of Washington, DC","-77.114192,38.810329,-76.909546,38.99588",""

The tracking of parcels was started in 1905 when, by Act of Congress, all the District’s unsubdivided properties which were mostly rural farms at the time were given parcel numbers. Their boundaries were also depicted (in many cases approximated), in large books in DCRA's Office of the Surveyor. Until the late 1960s, building permits were routinely issued by the city for new construction on Parcels, but today all Parcels, like Tax Lots, must be converted into subdivision Lots of Record before permits will be issued for exterior work. Parcels are only found in the old “County of Washington,” north of Florida Ave and east of the Anacostia River. There are no Parcels found within the original city limits or Georgetown. Parcels are not in Squares.

The BEPS is a minimum threshold of energy performance that will be no lower than the local median ENERGY STAR score by property type (or equivalent metric). The standards were created to drive energy performance in existing buildings to help meet the energy and climate goals of the Sustainable DC plan — to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption by 50% by 2032. DOEE established the first set of Standards on January 1, 2021. Standards will then be set every 6 years, creating BEPS Periods (BEPS Period 1, BEPS Period 2, etc.). The 2021 Building Energy Performance Standards and a Guide to the 2021 BEPS are available for viewing on DOEE’s website. To improve transparency and help building owners understand how their building performs relative to the BEPS, DOEE is publishing this BEPS Disclosure that compares a building’s benchmarking data with the BEPS and provides an estimate of the building’s distance from the standard and estimated performance requirement. Please note that this dataset is based on information currently available to DOEE using calendar year 2019 benchmarking data provided by the building owner. Some buildings are still being evaluated and therefore have been designated as “Under Review” in this dataset. Building owners that believe their 2019 calendar year data is incorrect should contact the Benchmarking Help Center (info.benchmark@dc.gov).

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2020 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous. For the 2020 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2010 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area.","1-Percent Public Use Microdata Area Code,106th congressional district Code,108th congressional district Code,3 digit ZIP Code Tabulation Area Code,5 digit ZIP Code Tabulation Area Code,5-Percent Public Use Microdata Area Code,age,Alaska Native Regional Corporation FIPS code,American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian Areas Census Code,boundaries,census,census bureau,Census Tract Number,census2020,Consolidated City FIPS Code,County FIPS Code,County or equivalent entity,County or Equivalent Entity,County Subdivision FIPS Code,DC GIS,Demographic,demographics,District of Columbia,Elementary School District Local Education Agency Code,FIPS 55 Place Code For All Places,housing units,income,Legislative Session Year,Metropolitan Statistical Area/Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area FIPS Code,New England County Metropolitan Area FIPS Code,People,population,Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area FIPS Code,Rreservation or Off-reservation Trust Land Indicator,Secondary School District Local Education Agency Code,State FIPS Code,State Legislative District Lower Chamber Code,State Legislative District Upper Chamber Code,Sub-minor Civil Division FIPS Code in Puerto Rico,Tabulation Block Number,Tribal Subdivision Code,U.S.,Unified School District Local Education Agency Code,Urban Growth Area Code,Voting District Code,Washington DC","Census Tracts from 2020.

Generally, census blocks are small in area (e.g., a block in a city). Census blocks in suburban and rural areas may be large, irregular, and bounded by a variety of features (e.g., roads, streams, and/or transmission line rights-of-way). In remote areas, census blocks may encompass hundreds of square miles. Census blocks cover all territory in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island areas. Blocks do not cross the boundaries of any entity for which the Census Bureau tabulates data. Census Block Numbers—Census blocks are numbered uniquely within the boundaries of each state, county, census tract with a 4-character census block number. The first character of the tabulation block number identifies the block group. A block number can only be unique by using the decennial census state (STATEFP), county (COUNTYFP), census tract (TRACTCE), and block (BLOCKCE)+.

Current block groups do not always maintain these same block number to block group relationships due to boundary and feature changes that occur throughout the decade. For example, block 3001 might move due to a change in the census tract boundary. Even if the block is no longer in block group 3, the block number (3001) will not change. However, the GEOID for that block, identifying block group 3, would remain the same in the attribute information in the TIGER/Line Shapefiles because block GEOIDs are always built using the decennial geographic codes. Block groups delineated for the 2020 Census generally contain 600 to 3,000 people. Local participants delineated most block groups as part of the Census Bureau's PSAP. The Census Bureau delineated block groups only where a local or tribal government declined to participate or where the Census Bureau could not identify a potential local participant. A block group usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains one or more block groups and block groups have unique numbers within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, block groups never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and AIANNH areas. Block groups have a valid range of zero (0) through nine (9). Block groups beginning with a zero generally are in coastal and Great Lakes water and territorial seas. Rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the 3-mile territorial sea limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore.","age,census,census blocks groups,dc,DC GIS,Demographic,demographics,District of Columbia,housing units,People,population,race,tract,Washington DC,census2020","Census Block Groups in 2020.

If an arrestee was charged with multiple marijuana charges, the arrest is only counted once under the more serious charge type (Manufacture/Cultivation > Distribution > Possession with Intent to Distribute > Possession > Public Consumption). The category of “Manufacture or Cultivation” was added in the 2019 data and for future years, but is not utilized in prior years. MPD collects race and ethnicity data according to the United States Census Bureau standards (https://www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about.html). Hispanic, which was previously categorized under the Race field prior to August 2015, is now captured under Ethnicity. All records prior to August 2015 have been updated to “Unknown (Race), Hispanic (Ethnicity).” Data on race and ethnicity prior to November 9, 2018 was based on officer observation; on and after November 9, 2018, the data is based on the arrestee’s response. MPD cannot release exact addresses to the general public unless proof of ownership or subpoena is submitted. The GeoX and GeoY values represent the block location (approximately 232 ft. radius) as of the date of the arrest. Due to the Department’s redistricting efforts in 2012 and 2019, data may not be comparable in some years. Arrestee age is calculated based on the number of days between the self-reported or verified date of birth (DOB) of the arrestee and the date of the arrest; DOB data may not be accurate if self-reported or if the arrestee refused to provide it. Due to the sensitive nature of juvenile data and to protect the arrestee’s confidentiality, any arrest records for defendants under the age of 18 have been coded as “NA” for the following fields: • Arrest Hour • CCN • Age • Offense Location Block GeoX/Y • Defendant Race • Defendant Ethnicity • Defendant Sex • Arrest Location Block Address • Arrest Location Block GeoX/Y This data may not match other marijuana data requests that may have included all law enforcement agencies in the District, or only the most serious charge.

One-Week Permits You can get a one-week disability permit if you only require the placard for a week or less (or you have a visitor who requires it), you have a short-term disability, or your vehicle with disability tags is being repaired. For a one-week permit, you do not need a doctor’s certification. The one-week permit is not renewable within a one-year period. Temporary Placards You can get a temporary disability placard if you have a physical condition that substantially impairs your mobility that is expected to last no longer than 8 years. Your medical practitioner must certify the application and indicate the expected length of your disability. If you find you need your disabled privileges longer, you must submit a new application with a medical practitioner's certification. Long-Term Placards You can get a long-term disability if you have a long-term disability. The list of qualifying disabilities is included on the application for the placard. You do not need a medical practitioner's certification if you have an obvious missing lower extremity or you use a motorized wheelchair. The long-term placard is valid up to 8 years to coincide with the expiration of your driver license or identification card. To renew it, you must submit a new application with a medical practitioner's certification. Temporary and long-term placards expire on the last day of the month and year indicated on the placard. Placards or permits should be hung from the rearview mirror while the vehicle is parked in a space authorized for the disabled and must be displayed and readable from the front windshield. They must be removed from the rearview mirror while the vehicle is in motion.","dmv,disability,placards,DC,District of Columbia,public safety,Washington DC","Active Disability Placard data","/Categories/Business Economy/Licensing","Department of Motor Vehicles","This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License .","en-us","https://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Transportation_DMV_WebMercator/MapServer/147","public","CC-BY-4.0","D.C.

These investments have proven to be critical in supporting mayoral initiatives, data driven decision making for District Government agency missions, increasing transparency and the more efficient use and sharing of government data.  Through the use of both policy and tools, the District Government has been able to work more cohesively to collect, integrate, analyze, and govern its data to deliver valuable services. In 2023, we achieved some great successes with our data programs and continue to provide data as part of the city's effort to enhance and improve digital services to District agencies, residents, and businesses.  We focused on growing our data strategy to support the way agencies can utilize data sharing and governance frameworks to guide their projects to successful outcomes.  We have been thoughtful about how we approach the use of generative artificial intelligence, balancing the need for guidance on the associated risks of utilizing tools and solutions with this technology against the benefits of how it can improve government services and the lives of residents and businesses.  These tools and solutions are often only as good as the underlying data that powers the models behind  them and therefore we know high quality data is key to the implementation of effective generative AI.  We continue to work towards closing the digital divide through our efforts to promote access and affordable broadband across the city.  Our data helped us inform the true landscape of the divide and as a result will provide the city with resources to support those who lack the use of what today is considered a technology of necessity.  We have formed new partnerships with District agencies for programs around the city where data becomes the backbone for the successful outcomes of these programs.","cdo,chief data officer,edi,enterprise dataset inventory,washington dc,district of columbia,dc,government operations,octo","The Government of the District of Columbia continues its strategic investment in enterprise data.

The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see Accuracy of the Data).  The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables. Data Processing Notes: This layer is updated automatically when the most current vintage of ACS data is released each year, usually in December. The layer always contains the latest available ACS 5-year estimates. It is updated annually within days of the Census Bureau's release schedule. Click here to learn more about ACS data releases. Boundaries come from the US Census TIGER geodatabases. Boundaries are updated at the same time as the data updates (annually), and the boundary vintage appropriately matches the data vintage as specified by the Census. These are Census boundaries with water and/or coastlines clipped for cartographic purposes. For census tracts, the water cutouts are derived from a subset of the 2010 AWATER (Area Water) boundaries offered by TIGER. For state and county boundaries, the water and coastlines are derived from the coastlines of the 500k TIGER Cartographic Boundary Shapefiles. The original AWATER and ALAND fields are still available as attributes within the data table (units are square meters). Field alias names were created based on the Table Shells file available from the American Community Survey Summary File Documentation page. Data processed using R statistical package and ArcGIS Pro. Margin of Error was not included in this layer but is available from the Census Bureau.  Contact the Office of Planning for more information about obtaining Margin of Error values."," Demographic Characteristics,Demographics,Census Tract","This layer contains the most current release of data from the American Community Survey (ACS) about demographic characteristics.

DC, is an interactive GIS map that provides historical data on
approximately 193,000 extant buildings in Washington, D.C. The map offers several operational layers of information
for the user including historic data on individual buildings and historic
districts, links to documentation on properties listed in the National Register
of Historic Places, information on historic residential subdivisions, and the
identification and boundaries of the L’Enfant Plan, and the city’s Squares, and
Wards. The featured layer in the map—the
Historical Data on DC Buildings—provides information from a variety of sources on
original dates of construction, architects, owners and builders of the city’s
historic buildings. The application also includes a Query tool that allows the
user to analyze the historic data within a specified geographic area or
city-wide.This application has evolved out of the DC Historical
Building Permits Database, begun in 2002, is on-going.  Requests to correct or add new information
can be made using the “Propose Data Change” drop-down form located on the
banner at the top of the map.

2017. Due to
technical difficulties, the downtown area is not comprised of true
orthoimagery. The contractor worked to minimize building lean by using the
increased side-lap of imagery. The
aerial imagery acquisition was flown to support the creation of 4-band digital
orthophotography with a 3 inch/0.08 meter pixel resolution over the full
project area covering the District of Columbia which is approximately 69 square
miles. The contractor received waivers to fly in the Flight Restricted Zone
(FRZ) and P-56 areas. The ortho imagery was submitted to the District's Chief
Technology Office (OCTO) in GeoTiff/TFW format tiles following the tile scheme
provided by OCTO. MrSID and JPEG2000 compressed mosaics were delivered as well
using a 50:1 compression ratio. All

DC Health delineates statistical neighborhoods to facilitate small-area analyses and visualization of health, economic, social, and other indicators to display and uncover disparate outcomes among populations across the city. The neighborhoods are also used to determine eligibility for some health services programs and support research by various entities within and outside of government. DC Health Planning Neighborhood boundaries follow census tract 2010 lines defined by the US Census Bureau. Each neighborhood is a group of between one and seven different, contiguous census tracts. This allows for easier comparison to Census data and calculation of rates per population (including estimates from the American Community Survey and Annual Population Estimates). These do not reflect precise neighborhood locations and do not necessarily include all commonly-used neighborhood designations. There is no formal set of standards that describes which neighborhoods are included in this dataset. Note that the District of Columbia does not have official neighborhood boundaries. Origin of boundaries: each neighborhood is a group of between one and seven different, contiguous census tracts. They were originally determined in 2015 as part of an analytical research project with technical assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) to define small area estimates of life expectancy. Census tracts were grouped roughly following the Office of Planning Neighborhood Cluster boundaries, where possible, and were made just large enough to achieve standard errors of less than 2 for each neighborhood's calculation of life expectancy. The resulting neighborhoods were used in the DC Health Equity Report (2018) with updated names. HPNs were modified slightly in 2019, incorporating one census tract that was consistently suppressed due to low numbers into a neighboring HPN (Lincoln Park incorporated into Capitol Hill). Demographic information were analyzed to identify the bordering group with the most similarities to the single census tract. A second change split a neighborhood (GWU/National Mall) into two to facilitate separate analysis.","ACS,American Community Survey,CDC,census tract,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists,CSTE,DC Health,disease,District of Columbia,DOH,epidemiology,health,HPN,neighborhood,statistic,Washington DC","This is a cross reference table to show DC Health neighborhood names for each 2010 Census Tract.

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979).

Additionally, the data are supplemented with hydrography data, buffered to become polygonal features, as a secondary source for any single-line stream features not mapped by the NWI and to complete segmented connections.

The linear hydrography dataset used to derive Version 2 was the U.S. Geological Survey's National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). Specific information on the NHD version used to derive Version 2 and where Version 2 was mapped can be found in the 'comments' field of the Wetlands_Project_Metadata feature class. Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands.

Approximately two-thirds of the District is served by a separate sewer system, while the remaining one-third is served by combined sewers. A combined sewer system conveys both sanitary sewage and storm water in one piping system. The District's combined sewer system was developed before 1900. Separate systems are comprised of two independent piping systems: one system for ""sanitary"" sewage (i.e., sewage from homes and businesses) and one system for storm water. During normal, dry weather conditions: Sanitary wastes collected in the combined sewer system are diverted to Blue Plains at facilities called regulators or dams. Typically, there are no overflows to the District's rivers and creeks. During periods of rainfall, the capacity of a combined sewer may be exceeded. When this occurs, regulators are designed to let the excess flow, which is a mixture of stormwater and sanitary wastes, be discharged directly into the District's rivers and creeks. This excess flow is called combined sewer overflow or CSO. Release of this excess flow is necessary to prevent flooding in homes, basements, businesses, and streets. CSO's are discharged to the Anacostia River, Rock Creek, Potomac River or tributary waters at CSO outfalls during most moderate rain events. There are a total of 48 potentially active CSO outfalls listed in the existing National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit from the United States Environmental Protection Agency.","combined sewer outfall,cso,water,dc water,district of columbia,dc,washington dc,environmental,waste water,storm water","This layer depicts the District Combined Sewer System (CSS) area.

Point sources in the NEI include large industrial facilities and electric power plants, airports, and smaller industrial, non-industrial and commercial facilities. A small number of portable sources such as some asphalt or rock crushing operations are also included. Some states voluntarily also provide facilities such as dry cleaners, gas stations, and livestock facilities, which are otherwise included in the NEI as nonpoint sources. The emissions potential of each facility determines whether that facility should be reported as a point source, according to emissions thresholds set in the Air Emissions Reporting Rule (AERR). NEI nonpoint sources include emissions estimates for sources which individually are too small in magnitude to report as point sources. These emissions sources are included in the NEI as a county total or tribal total (for participating tribes).Examples include residential heating, commercial combustion, asphalt paving, and commercial and consumer solvent use. NEI onroad sources include emissions from onroad vehicles that use gasoline, diesel, and other fuels. These sources include light duty and heavy duty vehicle emissions from operation on roads, highway ramps, and during idling. The US EPA uses the MOVES model to compute onroad source emissions based on model inputs provided by State, Local, and Tribal air agencies. The MOVES model also computes refueling emissions, which are included in the EIS Nonpoint Data Category. NEI nonroad sources include off-road mobile sources that use gasoline, diesel, and other fuels. Source types include construction equipment, lawn and garden equipment, aircraft ground support equipment, locomotives, and commercial marine vessels. For many nonroad sources, the EPA uses the MOVES-NONROAD model and these sources are included in the EIS nonroad Data Category. Starting with the 2008 NEI, some nonpoint sources are included in other EIS Data Categories. Aircraft engine emissions (occurring during landing and takeoff operations) and the ground support and power unit equipment are included in the EIS Point Data Category at airport locations. Locomotive emissions at rail yards are also included in the EIS Point Data Category. Emissions of other locomotive emissions and of commercial marine vessel emissions (both underway and port emissions) are included in the EIS Nonpoint Data Category. NEI ""event"" sources include fires that are reported in a day-specific format: wildfires and prescribed burns. Generally, the US EPA calculates these emissions using a satellite detection approach combined with fire models and activity data provide by State, Local, and Tribal air agencies or forestry agencies. Starting in the 2008 NEI, Wildfires and prescribed burning sources are included in the EIS Event Data Category. Agricultural fires are reported in the “Nonpoint” data category as an annual sum for a county. Taken as a sum, agricultural fires, prescribed fires, and wild fires make up the total emissions that comprise the “National Fire Emissions Inventory” (NFEI).","NEI,national emissions inventory,air quality,environment,pollution,district of columbia,washington dc,doee","Emissions Inventory for District of Columbia pulled from EPA's National Emissions Inventory (NEI).

More specifically, these changes have allowed for more detailed data collection on stops, protective pat down (PPDs), searches, and arrests. (For a complete list of terms, see the glossary on page 2.) These changes support data collection requirements in the Neighborhood Engagement Achieves Results Amendment Act of 2016 (NEAR Act). The accompanying data cover all MPD stops including vehicle, pedestrian, bicycle, and harbor stops for the period from July 22, 2019 to December 31, 2022. A stop may involve a ticket (actual or warning), investigatory stop, protective pat down, search, or arrest. If the final outcome of a stop results in an actual or warning ticket, the ticket serves as the official documentation for the stop. The information provided in the ticket include the subject’s name, race, gender, reason for the stop, and duration. All stops resulting in additional law enforcement actions (e.g., pat down, search, or arrest) are documented in MPD’s Record Management System (RMS). This dataset includes records pulled from both the ticket (District of Columbia Department of Motor Vehicles [DMV]) and RMS sources. Data variables not applicable to a particular stop are indicated as “NULL.” For example, if the stop type (“stop_type” field) is a “ticket stop,” then the fields: “stop_reason_nonticket” and “stop_reason_harbor” will be “NULL.” Each row in the data represents an individual stop of a single person, and that row reveals any and all recorded outcomes of that stop (including information about any actual or warning tickets issued, searches conducted, arrests made, etc.). A single traffic stop may generate multiple tickets, including actual, warning, and/or voided tickets. Additionally, an individual who is stopped and receives a traffic ticket may also be stopped for investigatory purposes, patted down, searched, and/or arrested. If any of these situations occur, the “stop_type” field would be labeled “Ticket and Non-Ticket Stop.” If an individual is searched, MPD differentiates between person and property searches. The “stop_location_block” field represents the block-level location of the stop and/or a street name. The age of the person being stopped is calculated based on the time between the person’s date ofbirth and the date of the stop. There are certain locations that have a high prevalence of non-ticket stops. These can be attributed to some centralized processing locations. Additionally, there is a time lag for data on some ticket stops as roughly 20 percent of tickets are handwritten. In these instances, the handwritten traffic tickets are delivered by MPD to the DMV, and then entered into data systems by DMV contractors. On August 1, 2021, MPD transitioned to a new version of its current records management system, Mark43 RMS. Due to this transition, the data collection and structures for the period between August 1, 2021 – December 31, 2021 were changed. The list below provides explanatory notes to consider when using this dataset. New fields for data collection resulted in an increase of outliers in stop duration (affecting 0.98% of stops). In order to mitigate the disruption of outliers on any analysis, these values have been set to null as consistent with past  practices. Due to changes to the data structure that occurred after August 1, 2021, six attributes pertaining to reasons for searches of property and person are only available for the first seven months of 2021. These attributes are: Individual’s Actions, Information Obtained from Law Enforcement Sources, Information Obtained from Witnesses or Informants, Characteristics of an Armed Individual, Nature of the Alleged Crime, Prior Knowledge. These data structure changes have been updated to include these attributes going forward (as of April 23, 2022). Out of the four attributes for types of property search, warrant property search is only available for the first seven months of 2021. Data structure changes were made to include this type of property search in future datasets. The following chart shows how certain property search fields were aligned prior to and after August 1, 2021. A glossary is also provided following the chart. As of August 2, 2022, these fields have reverted to the original alignment. https://mpdc.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/mpdc/publication/attachments/Explanatory%20Notes%202021%20Data.pdf In October 2022 several fields were added to the dataset to provide additional clarity differentiating NOIs issued to bicycles (including Personal Mobility Devices, aka stand-on scooters), pedestrians, and vehicles as well as stops related specifically to MPD’s Harbor Patrol Unit and stops of an investigative nature where a police report was written. Please refer to the Data Dictionary for field definitions. In March 2023 an indicator was added to the data which reflects stops related to traffic enforcement and/or traffic violations. This indicator will be 1 if a stop originated as a traffic stop (including both stops where only a ticket was issued as well as stops that ultimately resulted in police action such as a search or arrest), involved an arrest for a traffic violation, and/or if the reason for the stop was Response to Crash, Observed Moving Violation, Observed Equipment Violation, or Traffic Violation. Between November 2021 and February 2022 several fields pertaining to items seized during searches of a person were not available for officers to use, leading to the data showing that no objects were seized pursuant to person searches during this time period. Finally, MPD is conducting on-going data audits on all data for thorough and complete information. For more information regarding police stops, please see: https://mpdc.dc.gov/stopdata Figures are subject to change due to delayed reporting, on-going data quality audits, and data improvement processes.","arrest,crime,District of Columbia,force,MPD,officer contact,police,public safety,stop incidents,stop incident data,Washington DC","The accompanying data cover all MPD stops including vehicle, pedestrian, bicycle, and harbor stops for the period from July 22, 2019 to December 31, 2022.

Slashing our carbon pollution will require both imagination and bold action, from revisioning our streets, to transforming how we power our homes and buildings. While a climate strategy alone will not solve the racial inequities at the heart of our city’s biggest challenges, the scale of change required offers new avenues to advance opportunity.

A field contact report is also used to record general contact with a citizen. This dataset only captures the field contact type where the officer has indicated it is a stop by classifying it as a “pedestrian stop”, “vehicle stop”, or “bicycle stop.”A “stop” is a temporary detention of a person for the purpose of determining whether probable cause exists to arrest a person. A “frisk” is a limited protective search on a person to determine the presence of concealed weapons and/or dangerous instruments. The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) upgraded its records management system in 2012 and 2015. During each implementation, data collection processes may have changed. For example: - The date field for field contact reports prior to January 2, 2012 was not migrated to the current record management system. As a result, tens of thousands of records carry a date of January 1, 2012. Therefore, MPD is unable to provide field contact data prior to January 2, 2012. - With the implementation of the most recent RMS in 2015, MPD began collecting race and ethnicity data according to the United States Census Bureau standards (https://www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about.html). As a result, Hispanic, which was previously categorized under the Race field, is currently captured under Ethnicity. Race and ethnicity data are based on officer observation, which may or may not be accurate.

The road network is compiled to include all open intersections. Features do not overlap sidewalks, but have the sidewalk area cut out of the road polygons. Overlapping features are acceptable if one of the features is hidden. Road: A generally named thoroughfare, that is usually paved and can be public or private. Unimproved thoroughfares are excluded. Road polygons are formed by a combination of road edge, curb, sidewalk, street intersection closure line, and map sheet edge. Paved Median Island: Perimeter of non-traffic paved areas that separate traffic lanes in opposing directions. Unpaved Median Island: Perimeter of non-traffic grassy, unpaved areas that separate traffic lanes in opposing directions. Paved Traffic Island: Perimeter of non-traffic concrete areas in the middle of streets designed to segregate traffic flow. This does not include linear barriers, e.g., Jersey barriers, walls or guardrails, or point barriers, such as impact attenuators. Features do not overlap sidewalks. Unpaved Traffic Island: Perimeter of non-traffic unpaved, grassy areas in the middle of streets designed to segregate traffic flow. This does not include linear barriers, e.g., Jersey barriers, walls or guardrails, or point barriers, such as impact attenuators. Features do not overlap sidewalks. Alley: Perimeter of alleys first plotted photogrammetrically from other indicators such as building footprints, fence lines, curb lines, walls, paved or unpaved drives, and map sheet edge. Alley polygons are closed along the lines where they intersect with road polygons. Paved Drive: A paved driveway for a building or entranceway for a parking lot. Driveways are neither streets nor alleys, but provide access to public facilities, such as a drive to a monument, museum, hotel, large estate, sports field or golf course, grounds of the U.S. Capitol, etc. If a driveway is less than 200 feet and leads to a parking lot, the entire paved area is captured as Parking Lot. Driveways are photogrammetrically compiled as polygons and not compiled from individual vectors on different levels. Parking Lot: Generally paved surfaces used for cars to park on. Paved drives usually form entrances to these features, if the drive is more than 200 feet. If the driveway is less than 200 feet leading into the parking lot, the entire paved area is captured as Parking Lot. Parking lots sharing a common boundary with linear features must have the common segment captured once, but coded as both polygon and line. Small parking areas, where individuals park their cars in the middle of a block off a public alley, are not captured as parking lots.  These are either public space (e.g., alleys) or private space where owners permit parking to occur. Intersection: A location where more than one road comes together. For standard cross streets, intersection polygons are bounded by curbs and four closure lines at street intersection crosswalks (outer line) or placed arbitrarily where crosswalks could logically be placed. For ""T"" intersections, the polygons are bounded by curbs and three such closure lines. Complex intersections can have more closure lines. Entire traffic circles are coded as intersections. Hidden Road: A section of a road that passes underneath a bridge or overpass and is not visible in an aerial photograph, but the location can be interpreted based on the road on either side of the bridge. Hidden Median: A road median that exists underneath a bridge or overpass and is not fully visible in an aerial photograph, but the location can be interpreted based on the information visible on either side of the bridge.","alley,District of Columbia,driveway,median,OCTO,parking lot,planimetrics,road,street,Washington DC,dc,pmetric21","This dataset contains polygons representing planimetric roads, created as part of the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS) for the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO).

The road network is compiled to include all open intersections. Features do not overlap sidewalks, but have the sidewalk area cut out of the road polygons. Overlapping features are acceptable if one of the features is hidden. Road: A generally named thoroughfare, that is usually paved and can be public or private. Unimproved thoroughfares are excluded. Road polygons are formed by a combination of road edge, curb, sidewalk, street intersection closure line, and map sheet edge. Paved Median Island: Perimeter of non-traffic paved areas that separate traffic lanes in opposing directions.  Unpaved Median Island: Perimeter of non-traffic grassy, unpaved areas that separate traffic lanes in opposing directions.  Paved Traffic Island: Perimeter of non-traffic concrete areas in the middle of streets designed to segregate traffic flow. This does not include linear barriers, e.g., Jersey barriers, walls or guardrails, or point barriers, such as impact attenuators. Features do not overlap sidewalks. Unpaved Traffic Island: Perimeter of non-traffic unpaved, grassy areas in the middle of streets designed to segregate traffic flow. This does not include linear barriers, e.g., Jersey barriers, walls or guardrails, or point barriers, such as impact attenuators. Features do not overlap sidewalks. Alley: Perimeter of alleys first plotted photogrammetrically from other indicators such as building footprints, fence lines, curb lines, walls, paved or unpaved drives, and map sheet edge. Alley polygons are closed along the lines where they intersect with road polygons. Paved Drive: A paved driveway for a building or entranceway for a parking lot. Driveways are neither streets nor alleys, but provide access to public facilities, such as a drive to a monument, museum, hotel, large estate, sports field or golf course, grounds of the U.S. Capitol, etc. If a driveway is less than 200 feet and leads to a parking lot, the entire paved area is captured as Parking Lot. Driveways are photogrammetrically compiled as polygons and not compiled from individual vectors on different levels.  Parking Lot: Generally paved surfaces used for cars to park on. Paved drives usually form entrances to these features, if the drive is more than 200 feet. If the driveway is less than 200 feet leading into the parking lot, the entire paved area is captured as Parking Lot. Parking lots sharing a common boundary with linear features must have the common segment captured once, but coded as both polygon and line. Small parking areas, where individuals park their cars in the middle of a block off a public alley, are not captured as parking lots.  These are either public space (e.g., alleys) or private space where owners permit parking to occur. Intersection: A location where more than one road comes together. For standard cross streets, intersection polygons are bounded by curbs and four closure lines at street intersection crosswalks (outer line) or placed arbitrarily where crosswalks could logically be placed. For ""T"" intersections, the polygons are bounded by curbs and three such closure lines. Complex intersections can have more closure lines. Entire traffic circles are coded as intersections. Hidden Road: A section of a road that passes underneath a bridge or overpass and is not visible in an aerial photograph, but the location can be interpreted based on the road on either side of the bridge. Hidden Median: A road median that exists underneath a bridge or overpass and is not fully visible in an aerial photograph, but the location can be interpreted based on the information visible on either side of the bridge.","alley,District of Columbia,driveway,median,OCTO,parking lot,planimetrics,road,street,Washington DC,dc,currentplanimetrics","This dataset contains polygons representing planimetric roads, created as part of the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS) for the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO).

To meet this legal requirement, the Census Bureau set up a program that affords state officials an opportunity before each decennial census to define the small areas for which they wish to receive census population totals for redistricting purposes. Officials may receive data for voting districts (e.g., election precincts, wards) and state house and senate districts, in addition to standard census geographic areas such as counties, cities, census tracts, and blocks. State participation in defining areas is voluntary and nonpartisan.

Open Data DC is managed by the Enterprise Data team in the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO). We are a resource for data science tools for analytics; geospatial systems and applications; enterprise data integration solutions; and agency data warehousing. We promote open data by proactively working with agency partners to identify, curate, distribute, and use city government open data.

Opening government data increases citizen participation in government and creates opportunities for new and innovative ideas. DC government creates and works with information that is for and about the public and is collected using public funds, creating a sense of collaborative ownership between public bodies and their constituents. This collaborative ownership experience helps to promote open data being made available in a transparent manner with consideration of privacy and security.

Open Data provides usable data in several ways, allowing us to reach as many potential users as possible.

The dataset is updated weekly. The information provided is limited to the best available data in DC Water’s possession at the time the dataset was loaded. More Information on Water Main Breaks As the weather turns cold, water main breaks become more common. This is due to the expansion and contraction of the pipe material which weakens it. Pipe corrosion, soil conditions, age and ground movement can also cause water main breaks, creating unexpected problems for customers and motorists. DC Water averages between 400 and 500 water main breaks per year. During the busiest weeks, DC Water may have over 20 different water main breaks at one time. DC Water prioritizes water main repairs based on several factors such as severity of the break, impact to customers and the environment, potential damage to public and private property, and unsafe traffic conditions due to street flooding. Anyone observing water running from streets or sidewalks is encouraged to report the leak to DC Water. Report a problem online at dcwater.com.

This law: Prohibits the sale of all flavored tobacco—including flavored synthetic nicotine products. Prohibits the sale of all electronic smoking devices within a quarter mile of any middle or high school in the District. The prohibition on flavored tobacco includes any flavor other than tobacco, including “menthol.” The law presumes that a tobacco product is a flavored tobacco product if there are any texts, images, statements, or actions by the manufacturer that suggests the product has a flavor other than tobacco. Electronic smoking devices include any device that uses a heating element to deliver a vapor or aerosol with nicotine or any other substance in it for human consumption. It includes “vapes,” “vape pens,” “e-cigarettes,” “e-cigars,” “e-hookahs,” or any other product with that function, regardless of what it is called. The distance from a school is determined from the closest point between the school grounds and the property containing the retail space. Schools with combined campuses qualify if any students at that location are in grades 6 – 12.

These have been merged with Census poverty data to estimate how much of the population within these areas is food insecure (below 185% of the federal poverty line in addition to living in a low food access area). Office of Planning GIS followed several steps to create this layer, including: transit analysis, to eliminate areas of the District within a 10-minute walk of a grocery store; non-residential analysis, to eliminate areas of the District which do not contain residents and cannot classify as low food access areas (such as parks and the National Mall); and Census tract division, to estimate population and poverty rates within the newly created polygon boundaries. Fields contained in this layer include: Intermediary calculation fields for the aforementioned analysis, and: PartPop2: The total population estimated to live within the low food access area polygon (derived from Census tract population, assuming even distribution across the polygon after removing non-residential areas, followed by the removal of population living within a grocery store radius.) PrtOver185: The portion of PartPop2 which is estimated to have household income above 185% of the federal poverty line (the food secure population) PrtUnd185: The portion of PartPop2 which is estimated to have household income below 185% of the federal poverty line (the food insecure population) PercentUnd185: A calculated field showing PrtUnd185 as a percent of PartPop2. This is the percent of the population in the polygon which is food insecure (both living in a low food access area and below 185% of the federal poverty line). Note that the polygon representing Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling was removed from this analysis. While technically classifying as a low food access area based on the OP Grocery Stores layer (since the JBAB Commissary, which only serves military members, is not included in that layer), it is recognized that those who do live on the base have access to the commissary for grocery needs.

The analysis within the MFP will help the city to address the schools with over and under utilization, more efficiently prioritize and allocate capital funding, better utilize the DC Government’s real estate assets, and make better use of available resources in our growing public education system. Robust stakeholder engagement was an essential piece of the development of the MFP.

This is analogous to the removal of mass points for the same reason in a traditional photogrammetrically compiled DTM. This process was done in batch using proprietary software. The technicians then used proprietary software for the production of the lidar-derived hydro-flattened bare earth DEM surface in initial grid format at 1 m GSD. Water bodies (inland ponds and lakes), inland streams and rivers, and island holes were hydro-flattened within the DEM. Once the initial, hydro-flattened bare earth DEM was generated, the tiles were checked to ensure that the grid spacing met specifications. The surface was also checked to ensure proper hydro-flattening.This dataset provided as an ArcGIS Image service.

Large trees provide greater environmental benefits than smaller trees and are protected from unnecessary damage or removal by the Urban Forest Preservation Act and the Tree Canopy Protection Act in the District of Columbia. Any tree with a trunk greater than 100” in circumference is called a heritage tree. Heritage trees may only be removed if considered hazardous by a city arborist, otherwise, heritage trees cannot be removed, topped, girdled, or destroyed. If a heritage tree is within the limits of disturbance of a construction project, then they need to be properly protected throughout construction. However, there are times when the site plans cannot provide adequate protection, and so the only remaining legal option is to move the tree to a safer place on the property. This is a laborious, careful process, but ultimately preserves the environmental benefits and the cultural significance of the heritage tree.","D.C.

DC Health delineates statistical neighborhoods to facilitate small-area analyses and visualization of health, economic, social, and other indicators to display and uncover disparate outcomes among populations across the city. The neighborhoods are also used to determine eligibility for some health services programs and support research by various entities within and outside of government. DC Health Planning Neighborhood boundaries follow census tract 2010 lines defined by the US Census Bureau. Each neighborhood is a group of between one and seven different, contiguous census tracts. This allows for easier comparison to Census data and calculation of rates per population (including estimates from the American Community Survey and Annual Population Estimates). These do not reflect precise neighborhood locations and do not necessarily include all commonly-used neighborhood designations. There is no formal set of standards that describes which neighborhoods are included in this dataset. Note that the District of Columbia does not have official neighborhood boundaries. Origin of boundaries: each neighborhood is a group of between one and seven different, contiguous census tracts. They were originally determined in 2015 as part of an analytical research project with technical assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) to define small area estimates of life expectancy. Census tracts were grouped roughly following the Office of Planning Neighborhood Cluster boundaries, where possible, and were made just large enough to achieve standard errors of less than 2 for each neighborhood's calculation of life expectancy. The resulting neighborhoods were used in the DC Health Equity Report (2018) with updated names. HPNs were modified slightly in 2019, incorporating one census tract that was consistently suppressed due to low numbers into a neighboring HPN (Lincoln Park incorporated into Capitol Hill). Demographic information were analyzed to identify the bordering group with the most similarities to the single census tract.

During the annual mosquito season in Washington DC, usually from April – October, DC Health deploys surveillance and mitigation methods to control the mosquito population in the District. DC Health (also known as the D.C. Department of Health or formerly DOH) has been trapping and testing mosquitoes for West Nile virus (WNV) for well over a decade. Starting in 2016, and in response to the Zika outbreak in Latin America and the Caribbean, DC Health substantially increased mosquito monitoring activities across the city. There were a total of 28 sites and 36 traps across the 8 wards. Data was submitted to the Centers for Disease Control MoquitoNet Portal. Note: the 2017 analysis does not include data for October. This is because October of 2017 would have skewed the results far too much based on a few variables that occurred. For example, the number of traps which had failed by the end of the season. Mosquito species in Washington, D.C.: Culex Pipiens, Salinarius and Culex Restuan: spread West Nile Virus Aedes aegypti : according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), health experts have determined this species to be the most competent vector, capable of transmitting Zika to the human population. To date, none of the Aedes aegypti trapped in Washington, D.C. have been found to carry the Zika virus. Aedes albopictus: capable of spreading Zika to people. However, health experts are still learning whether it is likely to do so as it appears at this time, it is not as competent a vector for transmitting Zika as is the Aedes aegypti. Just because a mosquito can carry the virus does not mean that it will cause disease. So far, none of the Aedes albopictus trapped in Washington, D.C. have been found to carry the Zika virus. Aedes japonicus: normally found in South Florida, is present in D.C. in small numbers. Presently there is no indication that they are competent vectors for spreading Zika to the human population.","animal regulation,arbovirus,cdc,disease,doh,health,mosquito,trap,Washington dc,west nile virus,zika","This data is used for the planning and management of Washington, D.C. by local government agencies.","/Categories/Health and Human Services","https://dchealth.dc.gov","This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.","en-us","https://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Health_WebMercator/MapServer/11","public","CC-BY-4.0","City of Washington, DC","-77.14474152465803,38.80956472890744,-76.8999524011232,38.971769387509234",""

If Rt is above 1, the number of daily new infections will grow at an exponential rate. If it is below 1, the number of daily new infections will decrease. If field {ABOVE1=1}, then the transmission rate for that day did not meet the Reopening DC metric. The effective reproduction number must remain below 1 for a consecutive 5 days in order to achieve Reopening DC. The reproduction number is calculated in retrospect - data reported today is used to calculate the Rt for 14 days ago. This allows time for reported cases on a day to be more complete (~75% of cases reported), and calculates Rt over a 7−day window. Rt is primarily affected by 1) under-reporting rate over time, 2) caseload by start of infectious period, and 3) the serial interval (average between the start of the infectious period in one individual, and the start of the infectious period in an individual they infect). Rt is estimated from cases by start of infectious period using the EpiEstim algorithm, and the day plotted is the midpoint of the 7 day window. Rt may not be a reliable indicator of transmission as cases decline, as it becomes more uncertain with less data, and can be heavily impacted by disease events in other states which are imported into DC. For this reason, Rt is not measured at geographies below the city level. This data is used to calculate the Reopening DC metric where the effective reproduction number must be below 1 for 5 days.

Data include only community infections, not infections that happen in congregate settings. Congregate settings include jails, assisted living, and shelters. We restrict to community infections because infections that occur in congregate settings can be controlled through infection control efforts within the institution/facility. Users of the data should use the symptom onset date or estimated start of the infectious period (i.e., when a person can transmit the disease to another person), rather than the report date to give a better understanding of how the virus is spread across the District. June 22 was the calendar date where the policy effect took place. Data through June 22 are reported on June 24, and represent a symptom onset date of June 15. This data is used to calculate the Reopening DC metric with number of days where cases in the community by date of symptom onset (for symptomatic individuals) or estimated start of infectious period (for asymptomatic individuals) have decreased. A day of decrease is defined as a day where the number of new cases is less than 2 standard deviations of the 5 day rolling average from the previous low OR there has not been 3 days of consecutive increase. The count resets to the day with the closest most recent value when a peak is detected. The days in between are no longer counted. The goal of this metric is to reach 14 days of sustained decrease, with a final value below 131 cases per day (2 standard deviations below the initial peak).

The sum of the student group scores using all applicable STAR framework metrics. This is a number from 0 – 100 points. Overall STAR score for the school based on all applicable framework scores and student groups. Star value assigned to the school based on the STAR score.1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Supplemental: Metric scores are not reported for n-sizes less than 10; metrics that have an n-size less than 10 are not included in calculation of STAR scores and ratings. At the state level, teacher data is reported on the DC School Report Card for all schools, high-poverty schools, and low-poverty schools. The definition for high-poverty and low-poverty schools is included in DC's ESSA State Plan. At the school level, teacher data is reported for the entire school, and at the LEA-level, teacher data is reported for all schools only. On the STAR Framework, 203 schools received STAR scores and ratings based on data from the 2017-18 school year. Of those 203 schools, 2 schools closed after the completion of the 2017-18 school year (Excel Academy PCS and Washington Mathematics Science Technology PCHS). Because those two schools closed, they do not receive a School Report Card and report card metrics were not calculated for those schools. Schools with non-traditional grade configurations may be assigned multiple school frameworks as part of the STAR Framework. For example, a K-8 school would be assigned the Elementary School Framework and the Middle School Framework. Because a school may have multiple school frameworks, the total number of school framework scores across the city will be greater than the total number of schools that received a STAR score and rating. Detailed information about the metrics and calculations for the DC School Report Card and STAR Framework can be found in the 2018 DC School Report Card and STAR Framework Technical Guide (https://osse.dc.gov/publication/2018-dc-school-report-card-and-star-framework-technical-guide).","dcps,education,star,report card,osse,charter,schools,public school,learning,rating,score,student,performance,washington dc","2018 DC School Report Card.

The data is captured from a site visitor who can click or tap on a location to report a transportation hazard. Vision Zero is a part of Mayor Bowser’s response to the US Department of Transportation’s Mayor’s Challenge for Safer People and Safer Streets, which aims to improve pedestrian and bicycle transportation safety by showcasing effective local actions, empowering local leaders to take action, and promoting partnerships to advance pedestrian and bicycle safety. Vision Zero requires an all-hands-on-deck approach.
